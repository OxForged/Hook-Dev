/// @title LatchTimelock
/// @notice The delay that sits between the governance multisig and any privileged protocol call.
///
/// @dev ####################### WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN RAW OZ #######################
///
/// OpenZeppelin's `TimelockController` accepts `minDelay = 0` with no validation. A timelock
/// deployed that way looks correct on a block explorer, exposes the same interface, emits the
/// same events, and delays nothing. That is the single easiest way to ship governance theatre,
/// so this subclass refuses a delay below a floor chosen for the tier it protects.
///
/// ####################### WHY TWO TIMELOCKS, NOT ONE #######################
///
/// Delay should be proportional to how hard an action is to undo, and Latch has two very
/// different tiers:
///
///   CUSTODY tier — owns Vault and the pool managers.
///     `Vault.registerApp` is `onlyOwner` and IRREVERSIBLE: there is no unregister function
///     anywhere in the Vault or its interface. A registered app can move funds against the
///     Vault permanently. A mistake here cannot be walked back by governance at any speed, so
///     the only real defence is a window long enough for the public to notice and for users to
///     exit. Hence CUSTODY_MIN_DELAY.
///
///   POLICY tier — owns the protocol fee controller.
///     Fee changes are fully reversible and occasionally need to respond to market conditions.
///     A multi-day delay on a fee tweak buys nothing and creates pressure to hand someone an
///     emergency bypass, which is worse. Hence the shorter POLICY_MIN_DELAY.
///
/// These are separate contracts with separate owners, which is what makes two delays possible
/// at all — `Vault` has a single owner slot, so one timelock owning it means one delay for
/// everything it controls.
///
/// ####################### WHAT A TIMELOCK MUST NOT DELAY #######################
///
/// Delay belongs on privilege ESCALATION, never on privilege REDUCTION. If the only path to
/// switching protocol fees off runs through a two-day queue, then during an incident the
/// protocol keeps charging for two days. That is why `LatchProtocolFeeController` carries a
/// separate guardian that can disable fees immediately but can never enable them, raise them,
/// or change any configuration. The guardian can only ever make the protocol take less.
///
/// Do not add powers to the guardian. Anything that can increase what the protocol takes, or
/// change who controls it, belongs behind this timelock.
///
/// ####################### ONE TIER IS DEPLOYED, NOT TWO #######################
///
/// The `Tier` enum and `POLICY_MIN_DELAY` below are retained, and a Policy timelock still
/// constructs correctly - but only the CUSTODY tier is deployed. Everything the ownership table
/// previously routed through a 6h Policy timelock is now held by the governance Safe directly.
///
/// The reasoning is about who governance is FOR. A delay between a multisig and a privileged call
/// is a check on the signers, and with a single operator there are no other signers to check. What
/// survives that reframing is (a) surviving a stolen key and (b) being a credible base for a
/// tenant who would otherwise fork. Both of those are about IRREVERSIBLE authority -
/// `Vault.registerApp` and pool-manager ownership - and neither is served by queueing a fee tweak
/// or a registry role grant, which are reversible, custody nothing, and cost agility to delay.
/// Reality had already drifted this way: `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on the live registry is the Safe,
/// and the deployed Policy timelock holds nothing at all.
///
/// The type is kept whole because a second tier is a reasonable thing to want back the moment
/// there is a second signer. Deploying one is then a script change, not a contract change.
///
/// ####################### WHO CAN CANCEL #######################
///
/// `TimelockController` grants `CANCELLER_ROLE` to proposers and to nobody else. With the Safe as
/// sole proposer that means a 2-of-3 compromise which queues `updateDelay(0)` buys the public 48
/// hours of VISIBILITY with no party able to act on it - a delay that announces the attack and
/// then executes it. So the canceller is an explicit, separate constructor argument.
///
/// It is the right key to hold alone, for a reason that is structural rather than procedural: its
/// only power is REFUSAL. Losing it costs nothing that a redeploy of the role cannot restore, and
/// stealing it achieves nothing beyond griefing - a thief can veto honest operations and can never
/// cause one. That asymmetry is what makes a veto safe to hold on a hot key when the proposer is
/// not.

     * `msg.sender == address(this)`, and re-validates nothing. The tier floor was checked once, in
     * the constructor. So a single queued operation targeting the timelock itself set
     * `_minDelay = 0`, after which every later operation — `Vault.registerApp` included — executed
     * in the block it was queued. The tier stopped existing, and with `CANCELLER_ROLE` held only
     * by the compromised proposer there was nobody to stop it.
     *
     * Why here and not in an override of `updateDelay`. Solidity cannot call an `external` base
     * function through `super`, and `_minDelay` is private, so an override could reject a bad
     * delay but could never apply a good one. `_execute` is the single choke point instead: the
     * timelock makes external calls from nowhere else, so a self-targeted `updateDelay` cannot
     * reach the base implementation without passing through this check. A below-floor update
     * therefore REVERTS the execution — loudly, with the operation left pending and cancellable —
     * rather than succeeding and emitting a `MinDelayChange` that a monitor would read as the tier
     * being gone.
     *
     * Raising the delay, or setting it to exactly the floor, is untouched and still works.
