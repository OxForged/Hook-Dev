/**
 * The snapshot token `SnapshotEpochDistributor` measures holders against.
 *
 * WHY AUTO-DELEGATION IS NOT A CONVENIENCE. In OpenZeppelin's `Votes`,
 * `_transferVotingUnits` pushes to `_totalCheckpoints` only when `from` or `to`
 * is the zero address — that is, on mint and burn. So `getPastTotalSupply`
 * tracks TOTAL SUPPLY, while `getPastVotes` tracks DELEGATED voting units.
 * The two are different quantities, and the gap between them is silent.
 *
 * Run that through the distributor's formula:
 *
 *     payout = pot * getPastVotes(account, t) / getPastTotalSupply(t)
 *
 * A treasury holding 100% of an UNDELEGATED supply gives
 * `getPastTotalSupply = supply` (non-zero, so `NoVotingSupplyAtSnapshot` never
 * fires) and `getPastVotes = 0` (so every `claim` reverts `NothingToClaim`).
 * The epoch does not fail. It quietly pays nobody, and the entire pot sits
 * until somebody calls `rollover`. There is no error to notice and no event
 * that says "these funds were forfeited by a configuration mistake".
 *
 * That failure is one forgotten transaction away on any token without this
 * override, and it is worse for a multisig than for an EOA: a Safe would have
 * to collect a threshold of signatures for `delegate()` before the first epoch
 * closed, for a call that does nothing a holder can see. So delegation happens
 * here, on first receipt, where it cannot be forgotten.
 *
 * A HOLDER'S OWN CHOICE ALWAYS WINS, WHENEVER THEY MAKE IT. `_hasAutoDelegated`
 * records that the one-time assignment has been SPENT — not that the account
 * currently delegates to itself — and it is spent by any delegation, automatic
 * or deliberate. That is why `_delegate` is overridden rather than only
 * `_update`: OpenZeppelin routes `delegate` and `delegateBySig` through
 * `_delegate` without passing through `_update` at all, so a flag maintained
 * only on receipt misses both.
 *
 * The ordering that exposes it is not exotic. Somebody picks a delegate before
 * they hold anything — which is the ONLY possible ordering for a
 * `delegateBySig` gathered ahead of a distribution — and their first receipt
 * then resets them to self, emitting `DelegateChanged` and `AutoDelegated` as
 * though that were intended. Their dividend quietly stops going where they
 * sent it, because `SnapshotEpochDistributor` pays on votes, not on balance.
 *
 * The same rule makes opting out permanent: `delegate(address(0))` spends the
 * assignment, so later receipts do not re-delegate. A holder who chooses to
 * hold no voting power forfeits their share of each epoch to the rollover,
 * which is their decision to make.
 *
 * Dusting is therefore not a grief. An unsolicited transfer spends the
 * automatic assignment, but the recipient can still call `delegate` freely
 * afterwards — the flag only ever suppresses a FUTURE automatic assignment,
 * never a person's instruction.
 *
 * FIXED SUPPLY. There is no `mint`, no owner, no role and no upgrade path.
 * Supply is minted once, in the constructor, and that is the whole of it.
 *
 * The alternative — an ownable mint behind the governance Safe — would put an
 * inflation key in the hands of the same address that receives distributions,
 * able to dilute every other holder's claim on every future epoch without
 * touching the distributor at all. A snapshot distributor is only as honest as
 * the supply it measures against, so the supply is not something anybody gets
 * to change.
 *
 * CLOCK. `clock()` is left at OpenZeppelin's default of `block.number`.
 * `SnapshotEpochDistributor`'s constructor probes ERC-6372 and records the
 * domain, so this contract does not need to agree with anything by convention
 * — but block numbers are the safer default on a chain whose timestamps are
 * proposer-influenced, and an epoch boundary is exactly the kind of thing
 * worth not letting a proposer nudge.
