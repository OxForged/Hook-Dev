/**
 * Deploys `LatchVotes` and mints the entire supply to the governance Safe.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT CANNOT UNDO, and therefore checks first. The supply is
 * fixed at construction and there is no mint, no owner and no upgrade path. A
 * wrong recipient or a wrong supply is not a misconfiguration to be corrected
 * later — it is a token that has to be abandoned and redeployed, along with
 * every distributor already pointed at it. So every parameter is asserted
 * before the broadcast and every consequence is read back after it.
 *
 * THE RECIPIENT MUST HAVE CODE. The treasury is a Safe. A typo in an address
 * almost always lands on an EOA or on nothing at all, and minting a fixed
 * supply to an address nobody controls is unrecoverable in the most literal
 * sense. `code.length > 0` will not catch every mistake, but it catches the
 * whole class of mistakes that look like a correct address.
 *
 * SUPPLY IS REQUIRED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, deliberately without a default. A
 * default supply is a number nobody decided, and this one can never be changed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO. It does not deploy a distributor and it does
 * not touch `RevShareHook`. `SnapshotEpochDistributor` binds a PoolKey in its
 * own constructor, so it belongs to a pool, not to the token — see
 * `packages/hooks-revshare/script/DeploySnapshotDistributorMainnet.s.sol`.
 * Pointing a live pool at a distributor is a third, separate act that costs
 * `CONFIG_DELAY_BLOCKS` on an already-configured pool.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   VOTES_NAME="Latch Votes" VOTES_SYMBOL=LATCH \
 *   VOTES_TREASURY=0x715a6176946aDbD22c1B2021d321Fb3767ca3432 \
 *   VOTES_SUPPLY=1000000000000000000000000 \
 *   forge script script/DeployLatchVotesMainnet.s.sol --rpc-url $ROBINHOOD_RPC --broadcast --slow
