/**
 * Deploys THE governance timelock for a MAINNET chain. One, not two.
 *
 * ####################### ONE TIER #######################
 *
 * This script used to deploy a Custody (48h) timelock and a Policy (6h) one. It
 * now deploys only Custody. Everything the ownership table routed through Policy
 * — the protocol fee controller, the registry's `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, the RWA
 * hook owners, the position descriptor — is held by the governance Safe directly.
 *
 * The reason is about who a delay is for. A timelock between a multisig and a
 * privileged call is a check on the signers; with one operator there are no other
 * signers to check. What survives that is (a) surviving a stolen key and (b)
 * being a credible base for a tenant who would otherwise fork — and both are
 * about IRREVERSIBLE authority. `Vault.registerApp` cannot be undone at any
 * speed. A fee change can, a registry role grant can, and delaying those costs
 * agility for nothing. Reality had already drifted here: `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` on
 * the live registry is the Safe, and the deployed Policy timelock holds nothing.
 *
 * `LatchTimelock.Tier.Policy` and `POLICY_MIN_DELAY` are deliberately left intact
 * in the contract. Bringing a second tier back when there is a second signer is
 * then a change to this file, not to a deployed type.
 *
 * ####################### THE CANCELLER #######################
 *
 * `TimelockController` grants `CANCELLER_ROLE` to proposers and nobody else. With
 * the Safe as sole proposer, a 2-of-3 compromise that queues `updateDelay(0)`
 * bought the public 48 hours of VISIBILITY with no party able to act on it — a
 * delay that announces an attack and then executes it. The old version of this
 * script asserted PROPOSER and EXECUTOR and never looked at CANCELLER, which is
 * how the gap survived the first deployment.
 *
 * `GOVERNANCE_CANCELLER` is now explicit and is asserted below. It is the right
 * key to hold alone because its only power is refusal: losing it costs nothing a
 * queued `grantRole` cannot restore, and stealing it achieves griefing and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * Separate from `DeployGovernance.s.sol` rather than a flag on it. That script
 * makes the deployer both proposer and executor so Sepolia stays iterable — a
 * sensible testnet default and a catastrophic mainnet one, since it reduces the
 * whole governance model to a 48-hour delay on a single key. A boolean argument
 * deciding which of those two worlds you are in is a boolean somebody
 * eventually gets wrong at 2am. Two files, two names, no flag.
 *
 * THE ORDER MATTERS. These must exist BEFORE the Vault, because
 * `01_DeployVault.s.sol` ends with `transferOwnership(config.poolOwner)` — so
 * whatever the chain config names becomes the Vault's owner the instant it is
 * deployed. Deploy these first, paste the addresses into
 * `packages/core/script/config/latch-<chain>.json`, and the Vault is never
 * EOA-owned on mainnet, not for a single block. Deploying the Vault first and
 * transferring afterwards leaves a window in which one key can call
 * `registerApp`, which is irreversible.
 *
 * Usage (dry run first — no --broadcast):
 *   GOVERNANCE_SAFE=0x...  GOVERNANCE_CANCELLER=0x... \
 *   forge script script/DeployGovernanceMainnet.s.sol --rpc-url <chain>
