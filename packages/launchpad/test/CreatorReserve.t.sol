/**
 * ####### THE TWO PARAMETERS A CONTRACT WITH NO ADMIN CANNOT GET WRONG #######
 *
 * `CreatorReserve` has no owner, no pause, no upgrade and no setter. That is stated in
 * its header as a feature and it is one - the ranges ARE the disclosure a buyer relied
 * on, so nobody should be able to move them. But it has a consequence that a `constant`
 * gets exactly backwards: a value that turns out to be wrong for a launch can never be
 * corrected FOR THAT LAUNCH. There is no recovery path of any kind.
 *
 * `ROTATION_DELAY = 72 hours` and `MAX_RUNGS = 40` were compiled in. Neither is a safety
 * invariant the deployment must not be trusted with:
 *
 *   * the right rotation notice depends on whether the payout address is an EOA or a
 *     Safe whose signers are the same people either way;
 *   * the right rung count depends on the chain's block gas limit and nothing else.
 *
 * They are arguments now, each inside a constant range no launch may leave. The bounds
 * are the invariant; the values are the configuration. Every test below fails against
 * the pre-fix code, where there was no argument to reject.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE ONLY EXERCISES THE CONSTRUCTOR'S PARAMETER GUARDS. Those guards run
 * FIRST, ahead of anything that reads chain state, which is deliberate: they are the two
 * values that can never be corrected, so they should fail on something the caller typed
 * rather than after twenty `ownerOf` calls have already succeeded. That ordering is what
 * makes them testable without minting a ladder of real positions, and the ordering is
 * itself worth pinning - see `test_parameterGuardsRunBeforeAnyChainRead`.
