/// Every preset here is a PRICE, not a PROHIBITION. `LaunchGuardHook` taxes early buying on a
/// decaying schedule keyed to the block number. It does not, and at this layer cannot, identify
/// who is buying: the `sender` a hook callback receives is the Vault locker (the router), not the
/// trader, and `hookData` is attacker-controlled. So:
///
///   * NO PRESET HERE OFFERS A PER-WALLET CAP, AN ALLOWLIST, OR A "ONE BUY PER ADDRESS" RULE.
///     None is implementable honestly, and shipping a fake one is worse than shipping none.
///   * `maxBuyPerTx` bounds ONE TRANSACTION. Splitting a buy across N transactions, or N wallets,
///     in the same block defeats it completely. It raises the gas cost of a large snipe; it does
///     not cap anyone's position.
///   * A sniper willing to pay the opening tax buys anyway. That is the design: the tax accrues to
///     the pool's liquidity providers as an ordinary LP fee, so early extraction is redistributed
///     rather than prevented.
///   * Nothing here governs the TOKEN. Transfer restrictions, mint authority, LP-token custody and
///     the launcher's own conduct are all outside the pool. A guarded pool does not make a token
///     safe; it makes ONE pool's first minutes expensive to front-run.
///   * Nothing here governs OTHER venues. A second pool, an OTC block, or a CEX listing routes
///     around every preset in this file.
///
/// These presets are CL (concentrated-liquidity) only. `BinLaunchGuardHook` is capped at a 10% LP
/// fee by core (`BinPool` validates against `LPFeeLibrary.TEN_PERCENT_FEE`), so `AntiSniperAggressive`
/// and `Stealth` are simply unreachable on a bin pool and the numbers below would revert there.
