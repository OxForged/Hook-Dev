/// @title LatchLPLocker
/// @notice A one-way door for concentrated-liquidity position NFTs. A position that enters is never
/// withdrawn, transferred, burned or reduced by one unit of liquidity. Its swap fees keep flowing,
/// and are split between the launch's creator, an optional integrator (the tenant's fee wallet) and
/// the protocol, in proportions fixed at the moment the position arrived.
///
/// @dev ############################ THE NO-WITHDRAW GUARANTEE ############################
///
/// It is structural, not a policy check that could be mis-edited, and it rests on five facts about
/// `CLPositionManager` (read from the fork, not assumed from Uniswap):
///
///   1. Only the owner or an approved spender/operator can decrease, burn, subscribe, or transfer a
///      position (`onlyIfApproved`, solmate `transferFrom`). This contract is the owner.
///   2. This contract never calls `approve`, `setApprovalForAll`, `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`,
///      `subscribe` or `burn`. There is no generic call/execute/multicall path either.
///   3. The ONE call it makes to the position manager is `modifyLiquidities` with a plan built in
///      `collectFees` from literals: `CL_DECREASE_LIQUIDITY(tokenId, 0, 0, 0, "")` then
///      `TAKE_PAIR(currency0, currency1, address(this))`. A zero-liquidity decrease only credits
///      accrued fees; the amount is a literal, not a parameter.
///   4. `ERC721Permit.permit` / `permitForAll` verify an ERC-1271 signature when the owner is a
///      contract. This contract does NOT implement `isValidSignature`, so no signature can ever be
///      valid for it. Adding ERC-1271 here would break the guarantee - do not.
///   5. Arriving via `transferFrom` clears `getApproved[tokenId]` and unsubscribes any subscriber, so
///      nothing an earlier owner configured survives the transfer in.
///
/// `test/LatchLPLocker.invariant.t.sol` asserts it under random swaps, collections, claims, creator
/// rotations and direct attacker calls against the position manager.
///
/// ############################### ACCOUNTING ###############################
///
///   * PULL, never push. `collectFees` only credits `claimable[account][currency]`. A recipient that
///     reverts, is blacklisted, or is a contract that burns gas can only fail its OWN `claim`.
///   * Credit is what ARRIVED: `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` around the position-manager call, never
///     the amount the Vault was told to send. A fee-on-transfer quote token credits its net amount.
///   * `totalOwed[currency]` is the sum of every account's claimable balance. `skim` credits anything
///     above it to `protocolRecipient`, so donations and positive rebases are never stranded.
///   * Rounding: the creator and integrator shares are floored; the PROTOCOL receives the remainder.
///     The three shares always sum to the collected amount exactly, so no unit is lost or locked, and
///     the dust recipient is fixed rather than caller-dependent. The protocol therefore never receives
///     less than its bps and at most 2 base units more per currency per collection, which is also why
///     calling `collectFees` repeatedly cannot round the enforced protocol floor away.
///
/// ########################## WHAT IT DOES NOT PROTECT ##########################
///
///   * A token's issuer. Robinhood stock tokens can `pause`, `adminBurn` and be upgraded. While a
///     token in the pair is PAUSED, `collectFees` for that position reverts (the Vault's transfer to
///     this contract reverts); the fees stay inside the position, keep accruing, and are collectable
///     after unpause - nothing is lost, and positions in other pairs are unaffected. A PAUSED token's
///     already-credited balance cannot be claimed until unpause; the credit is not consumed by the
///     failed attempt. An `adminBurn` against this contract's balance makes that token INSOLVENT
///     here: claims are paid first-come until the balance runs out. The locker cannot prevent that
///     and does not pretend to; it isolates it to the burned token.
///   * A pool's economics. Positions are REFUSED when the pool's hook registers `beforeRemoveLiquidity`
///     or `afterRemoveLiquidity` (and therefore `afterRemoveLiquidityReturnsDelta`, which core only
///     permits alongside it): a zero-liquidity decrease runs those callbacks, so such a hook could
///     revert to block collection forever, or return a delta that takes the fees before they reach
///     this contract and so route around `minProtocolBps`. What the locker cannot see is a hook that
///     keeps the LP fee near zero and charges its own swap fee instead - the protocol floor applies to
///     LP fees, and only a kit that restricts which hooks it launches on can protect that base.
///   * Positions minted or plain-`transferFrom`-ed straight to this address. They arrive without
///     `onERC721Received` and therefore without a lock record, and nobody can ever attach one - an
///     unauthenticated "attach" would let the first caller name themselves creator. Such a position is
///     as unrecoverable as one sent to a dead address. Always use `safeTransferFrom` with `LockParams`.
///   * Bin positions, deliberately. Bin shares (`BinFungibleToken`) have no receiver callback, so a lock
///     cannot be authenticated by the transfer itself; and bin LP fees compound into `reserveOfBin`
///     (`BinPool.sol`, swap path) instead of accruing per position, so collecting them means BURNING
///     shares. That turns "liquidity never decreases" from a structural fact into an arithmetic claim.
///     It belongs in a separate contract - see `docs/kit-v2-integration.md`, section "Bin positions".
///
/// ############################### NO ADMIN ###############################

/// No owner, no pause, no upgrade, no setter. `protocolRecipient`, the protocol-bps bounds and the
/// integrator-bps cap are immutables chosen at deployment; the split of a lock is written once. The
