/// @dev What it deliberately does NOT have, because each is something a buyer would have to trust:
///   * no owner, no roles, no admin of any kind;
///   * no mint after construction - `totalSupply` is fixed in the constructor forever;
///   * no burn function, no pause, no blacklist, no transfer limit;
///   * no tax and no transfer hook - `_update` is not overridden, so a transfer moves exactly the
///     amount asked, which is what every AMM, router and locker in this repository assumes;
///   * no upgrade path and no proxy.
///
/// The constructor takes NO arguments; it reads them back from the deploying factory. That keeps the
/// creation code - and therefore its CREATE2 init-code hash - identical for every token, so:
///   1. the address depends only on (factory, deployer, salt), which is what lets a vanity salt be
///      mined off chain once and reused with any name; and
///   2. the MIT SDK can predict addresses from a 32-byte hash it reads on chain, without shipping
///      this contract's GPL-derived bytecode.
