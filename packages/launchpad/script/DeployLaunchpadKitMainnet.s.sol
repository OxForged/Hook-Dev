/**
 * STEP 2 OF 2. Deploys `LaunchpadKit` to a MAINNET chain.
 *
 * Run `DeployLaunchGuardHookMainnet.s.sol` first and export its address as
 * `LAUNCH_GUARD_HOOK`. The kit pins the hook as an immutable and verifies it in
 * its own constructor, so a kit deployed against the wrong hook is not a
 * misconfiguration to be corrected later — it is a contract to abandon.
 *
 * ############################ WHAT CANNOT BE UNDONE ############################
 *
 * Everything. `LaunchpadKit` has no owner, no admin, no guardian, no pause and
 * no upgrade path, and every constructor argument is an immutable. There is no
 * function on it that governance could call, which is why it has no row of its
 * own in CLAUDE.md's ownership table beyond "nothing to assign". The flip side
 * is that a wrong argument here is permanent, so every one of them is asserted
 * before the broadcast and read back after it.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: THE `Ownable2Step` TRAP DOES NOT APPLY HERE, and that is worth
 * stating rather than leaving to inference. Elsewhere in this protocol
 * `transferOwnership` only NOMINATES — the nominee must call
 * `acceptOwnership()`, and a script that transfers and prints success leaves
 * the deployer in place looking fine on a block explorer. This contract is not
 * `Ownable` at all. Nothing is pending, nothing needs accepting, and the
 * deployer holds no authority over it the moment this script returns. The only
 * authority the kit ever exercises is being the hook's `launchOwner` for pools
 * it creates, which it delegates to the per-launch `operator` recorded at
 * `createLaunch`. That operator is chosen by the launcher, not by governance.
 *
 * THERE IS NO BLOCK TIME TO GET RIGHT ANY MORE (Option B, 2026-09-13). The retired
 * kit `0x2a4C…bcA7` took `blockTimeCentis = 10` — the RPC's 0.1 s L2 block on an
 * Arbitrum Nitro chain whose EVM `block.number` is Ethereum's ~12 s — and so ran its
 * "five minute" FairLaunch for ~10 HOURS. This kit writes preset windows to the hook
 * as seconds of `block.timestamp`, unconverted, and its constructor refuses any hook
 * that does not answer `CLOCK_MODE() == "mode=timestamp"`, so it cannot be wired to
 * the retired block-numbered hook `0x8b4F…575c` by mistake.
 *
 * `run()` still probes the chain's `block.timestamp` against the RPC header and this
 * machine's wall clock before it will broadcast. No waiting.
 *
 * The script prints every preset's window in seconds and asserts each one sits inside
 * the hook's [MIN_DECAY_SECONDS, MAX_DECAY_SECONDS], so a preset the hook would refuse
 * is a failed dry run rather than a failed launch.
 *
 * THE REGISTRY IS IMMUTABLE ON THE KIT. `LaunchpadKit` cannot be re-pointed at
 * a new registry, and this project has already replaced one
 * (`LatchHookRegistry` -> `LatchRegistry`, 2026-09-10, with the retired address
 * still answering `hookCount()` and still holding the original listing). Give
 * this the LIVE registry or `address(0)`; a dead one bricks the listing path
 * for the life of the kit. `address(0)` must be passed explicitly — there is no
 * default, because "I forgot to set it" and "I meant no registry" must not look
 * the same.
 *
 * BUILD PROFILE: THE DEFAULT ONE. Robinhood Chain supports EIP-1153 (verified
 * across its endpoints — see `packages/sdk/src/chains/endpoints.ts`), so this
 * deploys the cancun build. Neither contract deployed here uses transient
 * storage itself, but a cancun build emits MCOPY, and `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=legacy`
 * would produce shanghai bytecode that is merely less efficient rather than
 * wrong. Do NOT reach for the legacy profile on this chain: the live Vault and
 * position manager are the cancun build, and mixing backends is how
 * `TransientSlot.IS_EIP1153` stops meaning anything.

 * NO CREATE3, for the same reasons as step 1: nothing depends on this address
 * being identical across chains, and a CREATE3 broadcast artifact reports the
 * FACTORY as `contractAddress` with the real deployment buried in the `CREATE`
 * entry of `additionalContracts`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCRIPT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It creates no pool, seeds no
 * liquidity and lists nothing in the registry. Listing the hook is a separate,
 * permissionless act (`LaunchpadKit.listHook`, or the registry directly) whose
 * steward is a human decision. A deployment that quietly creates a pool as a
 * side effect is how a test fixture ends up on mainnet.
 *
 * Usage (dry run first — no --broadcast):
 *   CL_POOL_MANAGER=0xf4A28fA4CFeCAEf349A7D52fA1eB4dF56EB22F66 \
 *   LAUNCH_GUARD_HOOK=0x...                                    \
 *   CL_POSITION_MANAGER=0x957cc13b24a563cc92253213d9d5e6954c8db6a7 \
 *   PERMIT2=0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3          \
 *   LAUNCHPAD_REGISTRY=0xb2c8BB7473A09b0906f192D69e30D7362fA988CC \
 *   forge script script/DeployLaunchpadKitMainnet.s.sol --rpc-url $ROBINHOOD_RPC
 *
 * Then, when a human has read the simulation:
 *   ... --broadcast --slow
