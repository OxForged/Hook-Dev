/// @notice The chain of custody that turns "somebody says this pool exists" into a fact.

/// @dev ############ WHY THIS IS A LIBRARY AND NOT A COPY IN EACH REGISTRY ############
///
/// Both `LatchRegistry` (which attests a Latch's permission bitmap) and `LatchLaunchRegistry`
/// (which attests that a launch's pool is real) rest on the same three-step proof, and it is the
/// only load-bearing security logic either of them has. Two copies of it is two chances to fix a
/// bug in one place and not the other, so there is exactly one copy and both call it.
///
/// ############################ WHAT THE PROOF ESTABLISHES ############################
///
/// A `PoolKey` read back out of a pool manager is not a claim, it is a measurement, because of how
/// it got there:
///
///   - `CLPoolManager.initialize` / `BinPoolManager.initialize` call `Hooks.validateHookConfig`,
///     which requires `poolKey.hooks.getHooksRegistrationBitmap() == poolKey.parameters` bitmap.
///     That is the only time core ever asks the hook anything.
///   - Immediately after, the manager writes `poolIdToPoolKey[id] = key`.
///   - Every dispatch from then on reads `key.parameters`, never the hook. `parameters` is part of
///     the pool id, so it is IMMUTABLE for the life of that pool.
///
/// So the stored key is a bitmap the hook answered with at least once, under core's own eyes and
/// not ours, and it is what that pool enforces today. A hook cannot lie to this, because the lie
/// would have stopped the pool existing.
///
/// The trust anchor is the Vault, not a list either registry keeps. A pool manager is believed iff
/// `Vault.isAppRegistered(manager)`, which is `onlyOwner` on the 48h custody timelock and grants
/// permanent authority to move Vault funds. Anything trusted that far is trusted to report its own
/// pool keys. A curator-managed allowlist instead would let an Ops hot key enroll a fake "pool
/// manager" and mint proofs for anything it liked, which is the laundering this closes.
///
/// ####################### THE ERRORS ARE DELIBERATELY DUPLICATE #######################
///
/// `UntrustedPoolManager`, `PoolNotFound` and `PoolHookMismatch` are also declared on
/// `ILatchRegistry`. Error selectors come from the signature and not from the declaring scope, so
/// these revert with the identical four bytes and every existing consumer — tests included — keeps
/// matching. Do not "unify" them by making this library import the interface: the dependency would
/// run the wrong way, and a library that pulls in a registry interface cannot be reused by the next
/// contract that needs the proof.
