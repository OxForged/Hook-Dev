///
/// @dev ####################### WHY THIS CONTRACT EXISTS #######################
///
/// Latch is infrastructure other people ship on. A tenant deploys their own launchpad, their own
/// hook and their own UI against the Vault and pool managers Latch already has live. The thing
/// that makes being a tenant worth more than forking the whole stack is that a launch registered
/// here is visible in EVERY tenant's marketplace, while a full fork starts with an empty index.
/// That is the network effect, and it is one of the few defensible assets in a GPL codebase.
///
/// A network effect made of unverifiable records is not an asset, it is a liability, because the
/// first convincing fake launch teaches every reader to discount the whole index. So the governing
/// question for every line below is: WHAT CAN ACTUALLY BE PROVEN ON CHAIN, and what has to be
/// labelled as somebody's word.
///
/// ############################ WHAT IS PROVEN ############################
///
/// Every record in this registry is pool-proven. There is no such thing as an unverified pool
/// here: `registerLaunch` reads the `PoolKey` back out of a pool manager the Vault has registered
/// (`PoolProof`, shared with `LatchRegistry.attestFromPool`), so these are measurements:
///
///   - the pool exists and is initialized;
///   - its two currencies, its fee, and its hook;
///   - the permission bitmap that hook enforces in that pool, from the immutable `parameters`;
///   - that the launched token is one of the two currencies.
///
/// Also read rather than accepted: the token's own `name()`, `symbol()` and `decimals()`. A
/// registrant CANNOT type a name or a symbol into a record. Listing a worthless token under the
/// symbol `USDC` is the oldest launchpad scam there is, and an official-looking index that let a
/// submitter supply the ticker would be performing the laundering rather than preventing it.
///
/// ########################## WHAT CANNOT BE PROVEN ##########################
///
/// Two things, and they are stated here because a reader deserves to know where the floor is:
///
///   1. WHEN A POOL OPENED. Core stores no initialization timestamp — `poolIdToPoolKey` has no
///      such field and `getSlot0` carries price and fees, not time. `registeredAt` is when THIS
///      RECORD was written, which for a retroactively indexed launch can be months late. It must
///      never be rendered as a launch date. An indexer that wants the real one has to read the
///      manager's `Initialize` log, which no contract can do.
///
///   2. WHO OPENED IT. Core keeps no creator either; the sender survives only in that same log.
///      "Launched via Acme" is therefore a fact only Acme's own contract holds, which is the
///      entire reason `LaunchOrigin` exists.
///
/// ################ HOW ATTRIBUTION IS MADE UNFORGEABLE ANYWAY ################
///
/// A launch record may name a launchpad only when the launchpad's own code named the pool. Two
/// accepted paths, no others:
///
///   - the launchpad IS `msg.sender`. Unforgeable by construction, and when the registration sits
///     in the same transaction as `initialize` it cannot even be front-run;
///   - the launchpad answers `ILatchLaunchOrigin.launchOriginOf(poolId)` with a non-zero creator,
///     through the same gas-capped, size-checked `staticcall` discipline `LatchRegistry` uses on
///     an unvetted hook.
///
/// Anything else REVERTS. There is no "claimed launchpad" field to downgrade into, because a field
/// holding an unproven name is a field some front end will render without the caveat. The result
/// is the property the whole network effect rests on:
///
///     NOBODY CAN HANG A LAUNCH OFF SOMEBODY ELSE'S LAUNCHPAD.
///
/// And plainly, the property it does NOT give: a launchpad that answers `launchOriginOf` for pools
/// it did not create can steal attribution FOR itself. It cannot fake being a different launchpad,
/// only over-claim as itself, and it does so at an address a curator can clear and a guardian can
/// flag. `provenanceOf` therefore returns the launchpad's verification and listing status in the
/// same call as the attribution, so no UI can show the second without the first.
///
/// ########################### NO ROLES OF ITS OWN ###########################
///
/// This contract deliberately does NOT inherit AccessControl. `CURATOR_ROLE` and `GUARDIAN_ROLE`
/// are read from the live `LatchRegistry`, which already owns that governance surface and whose
/// role assignments are tabulated in CLAUDE.md. One admin, one place to grant curation, no new row
/// in the ownership table, and a curator appointed to handle a malicious Latch can flag the
/// launches that use it without a second grant landing first. The cost, accepted: this registry
/// cannot have a curator the Latch registry does not, and pointing it at a different registry
/// address would repoint its governance — which is why `latchRegistry` is immutable.
///
/// ########################## WHY NOTHING IS DELETED ##########################
///
/// Same as `LatchRegistry`, for the same four reasons, and one more that is specific to launches:
/// the users who most need a `Malicious` flag on a launch are the ones already holding the token.
/// Delisting is precisely the moment they stop being able to look it up.
