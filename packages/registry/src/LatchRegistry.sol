/// @title LatchRegistry
/// @notice The discovery and safety surface for LatchProtocol hooks.
///
/// @dev ################### WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ACTUALLY FOR ###################
///
/// A Latch hook can be attached to a pool from any address — permissions live in the pool key and
/// are cross-checked against the hook, so there is no CREATE2 salt mining and therefore no address
/// to read capabilities off. That is a real developer advantage and it moves an entire class of
/// risk off-chain: a user looking at `0xAbCd…` has no way to see, from the address alone, that the
/// hook behind it holds `beforeSwapReturnsDelta` and takes 30 bps of every trade in the pool.
///
/// This registry exists to put that back on-chain, and it is a SAFETY surface before it is a
/// DISCOVERY surface. Three rules follow from that and none of them are negotiable:
///
///   1. PERMISSIONS COME FROM THE HOOK, NEVER FROM THE SUBMITTER. `register` reads
///      `getHooksRegistrationBitmap()` off the hook contract. There is no parameter through which
///      a submitter can declare, suggest or influence what their hook is allowed to do. A registry
///      that took the submitter's word for it would be worse than no registry, because it would
///      launder a lie through an official-looking surface.
///
///      AND THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN — see the next section. Reading the bitmap off the
///      hook removes the SUBMITTER from the loop. It does not remove the HOOK from the loop, and
///      the hook is the party with the motive.
///
///   2. NOBODY CAN PROMOTE THEMSELVES. Every hook enters at `Unverified`. Only a curator moves it
///      up the ladder, and any subsequent change to the metadata or to the hook's own code knocks
///      it straight back down. The bait-and-switch — get audited, then repoint `sourceURI` at
///      something else, or upgrade the implementation behind a proxy — is the attack this defends.
///
///   3. LISTING IS FREE AND UNGATED. No fee, no allowlist, no minimum stake. A listing fee taxes
///      exactly the independent developers the marketplace exists to attract, while being pocket
///      change to anyone running a scam at scale. Spam is priced by gas, which is the only
///      mechanism here that charges an attacker more than it charges an honest developer.
///
/// ########################### WHY NOTHING IS EVER REMOVED ###########################
///
/// There is no `delete`, no `unregister`, no owner escape hatch that erases a record. This was the
/// hardest call in the design and it went this way for four reasons:
///
///   - Deletion and censorship are the same transaction. Whoever holds a delete key can silently
///     remove a competitor. There is no on-chain way to tell that apart from removing a scam, and
///     "trust our curators not to" is exactly the assumption a registry should not require.
///
///   - Deleting a malicious hook DESTROYS THE WARNING. Absence is indistinguishable from "never
///     submitted". The users who most need the warning are the ones already in that hook's pool,
///     and delisting is precisely the moment they stop being able to look it up. A `Malicious`
///     tombstone with a reason string is strictly more protective than an empty slot.
///
///   - Log replay must be deterministic. The events here are specified so an indexer can rebuild
///     the entire registry from scratch. Deletion introduces state that exists in the log history
///     and not in storage, and every consumer then has to agree on how to reconcile that.
///
///   - Removal buys nothing. Every effect a delete could have — hide from default listings, warn
///     loudly, break the audited badge — is already reachable through `Listing.Malicious`, which
///     also force-resets verification. The only additional thing delete offers is deniability.
///
/// The cost of this choice, stated plainly: the registry accumulates junk forever, and a hook
/// squatted by a bad-faith first submitter can never have its entry vacated. Both are handled by
/// filtering rather than erasure — see `transferSteward` for the squatting case.
///
/// ####################### CALLING AN UNTRUSTED CONTRACT #######################
///
/// `register` and `refreshPermissions` call an address nobody has vetted. Core makes the same call
/// in `Hooks.validateHookConfig` with all remaining gas and no guards, which is safe there only
/// because a hostile hook that bricks its own pool initialization harms nobody else. Here it would
/// be a shared surface, so the call is made through `_probePermissions`:
///
///   - hard gas cap of `PROBE_GAS`, so an infinite loop costs its own submitter and stops;
///   - output buffer fixed at 32 bytes, so a return bomb cannot make us pay to copy it;
///   - `returndatasize() == 32` checked, so a short or empty return is a failure, not a zero;
///   - the raw word is rejected unless it fits in a `uint16`, matching what solc's own ABI decoder
///     would accept, so dirty high bits cannot be laundered into a small bitmap;
///   - `staticcall`, so the probe cannot reenter or write anything;
///   - a `gasleft()` floor, so an "unreadable" verdict is always about the hook and never about a
///     caller who deliberately starved the frame. Without it, anyone could call
///     `refreshPermissions` with hand-tuned gas and demote an honest audited hook.
///
/// A hostile hook can therefore make its own registration fail. It cannot make anyone else's fail,
/// and it cannot cost a caller more than the probe budget.
///
/// ############### WHY THE PROBE ALONE CANNOT BE BELIEVED: ATTESTATION ###############
///
/// `getHooksRegistrationBitmap()` is `view`, and a `view` function can read `msg.sender` and
/// `gasleft()`. Everything the probe does is defensive about the CALL; none of it makes the ANSWER
/// true. A hook can branch:
///
///     function getHooksRegistrationBitmap() external view returns (uint16) {
///         if (msg.sender == LATCH_REGISTRY) return TAME;   // afterSwap only
///         return TAME | BEFORE_SWAP | BEFORE_SWAP_RETURNS_DELTA;   // takes a cut
///     }
///
/// and the registry records `TAME`. `classify` then returns `Passive`, `takesSwapCut` returns
/// false, and the marketplace shows "observes only, takes no cut" above a pool that is skimming
/// every trade. `refreshPermissions` is permissionless but still calls FROM this address, so it
/// re-reads the same lie forever and the codehash never moves.
///
/// Probing differently does not fix this and the road is a dead end. A fresh disposable prober
/// beats the `msg.sender` branch but not `if (gasleft() < N)`. Raising `PROBE_GAS` moves the
/// threshold. Any budget this contract commits to is itself a signal the hook can key off. The
/// fixed point of that game is: an untrusted `view` function is a claim, never a measurement.
///
/// So the registry reads the bitmap from somewhere the hook cannot reach — A POOL CORE HAS ALREADY
/// VALIDATED. The chain of custody:
///
///   - `CLPoolManager.initialize` / `BinPoolManager.initialize` call `Hooks.validateHookConfig`,
///     which requires `poolKey.hooks.getHooksRegistrationBitmap() == poolKey.parameters` bitmap.
///     That is the only time core ever asks the hook.
///   - Immediately after, the manager writes `poolIdToPoolKey[id] = key`.
///   - Every dispatch from then on reads `key.parameters`, never the hook — see
///     `CLHooks.shouldCall`. `parameters` is part of the pool id, so it is IMMUTABLE for the life
///     of that pool.
///
/// Therefore `poolIdToPoolKey[id].parameters` is a bitmap that (a) the hook answered with at least
/// once, under core's own eyes and not ours, and (b) is what that pool actually enforces today.
/// `attestFromPool` reads exactly that. A hook cannot lie to it, because a lie there would have
/// prevented the pool from existing.
///
/// The trust anchor is the Vault, not a list this contract keeps. A pool manager is believed iff
/// `Vault.isAppRegistered(manager)`, which is `onlyOwner` on the 48h custody timelock and grants
/// permanent authority to move Vault funds. Anything already trusted that far is trusted to report
/// its own pool keys. The alternative — a curator-managed allowlist — would let an Ops hot key
/// enroll a fake "pool manager" and mint attestations for any bitmap it liked, which is precisely
/// the laundering this whole mechanism exists to stop.
///
/// What an attestation is and is not:
///   - It proves the hook presented that bitmap to core for that pool. It does NOT prove the hook
///     presents the same bitmap everywhere. The same hook can back a CL pool and a Bin pool with
///     different bitmaps, honestly.
///   - `attestedPermissions` is therefore the UNION over every attested pool, and attestations are
///     monotone: they only ever add bits, and no role can clear them. Overstating is a survivable
///     error; understating is the one that costs somebody their money.
///   - `effectivePermissions` is `selfReported | attested`, so no combination of hook behaviour and
///     attestation order can produce a bitmap milder than something already observed.
///   - Anyone may attest. There is no way to use it to make a record look cleaner, so there is no
///     reason to gate it.

    /*//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
                        ADMIN ROLE CANNOT BE DROPPED

        AccessControl's default behaviour lets the sole holder of
        DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE walk away — `renounceRole`, or
        `revokeRole` on itself. Here that is a one-way brick: the
        admin role is the ONLY way to appoint a curator or a
        guardian, and there is no other path to either. Listings
        would keep working (register and refreshPermissions are
        permissionless), but nothing could ever be badged again and
        NOTHING COULD EVER BE FLAGGED MALICIOUS AGAIN. A safety
        surface that cannot raise an alarm is worse than none,
        because it still looks like one.

        This is the registry's analogue of the `renounceOwnership`
        finding open against the RWA hooks and the oracle. Two
        guards, because the two paths are distinct: renouncing the
        admin role is refused outright (there is never a good reason
        — hand it to a successor instead), and revoking is refused
