/// @title MarketHoursModule
/// @notice The three controls a tokenized-equity pool needs that a 24/7 AMM does not provide: a
/// trading calendar, an instant halt, and a price band enforced against a pluggable reference
/// oracle. Written as a mixin so it can be worn by a bare hook (`MarketHoursHook`) or bolted onto
/// the compliance gate (`StockPairHook`) without either one duplicating the other.
///
/// @dev ################### NO LEGAL ADVICE IS GIVEN OR IMPLIED ###################
///
/// This contract is a MECHANISM. It stops a pool trading outside hours an issuer chose, while an
/// issuer-chosen party says it is halted, and at prices outside a band an issuer-chosen oracle
/// implies. Whether any configuration of it discharges any market-structure obligation, listing
/// rule, exchange registration requirement, limit-up/limit-down regime, best-execution duty or
/// fair-and-orderly-market standard in any jurisdiction is a question for the issuer's counsel. It
/// is not answered here, it is not answered by the code, and no statement in this repository
/// should be read as answering it.
///
/// In particular: naming a control "circuit breaker" does not make it one in the regulatory sense,
/// and matching a venue's published session times does not make this pool that venue.
///
/// #####################################################################################
/// ############################ 1. THE TRADING CALENDAR ############################
/// #####################################################################################
///
/// A weekly base schedule plus per-day overrides, both resolved in O(1). Everything is UTC.
///
///   * `weekdayMask` - bit `i` set means weekday `i` is a trading day, with 0 = Sunday. Unix day 0
///     (1970-01-01) was a Thursday, so the weekday of day index `d` is `(d + 4) % 7`.
///   * `openSecondOfDay` / `closeSecondOfDay` - the session window within a trading day. `open <
///     close` is an ordinary same-day session. `open > close` WRAPS past midnight and the session
///     is attributed to the day it OPENED on, which is the day whose weekday bit and whose
///     override are consulted. `open == close` is rejected at configuration time as ambiguous.
///   * Per-day overrides, keyed by `timestamp / 86400`, express holidays (`setHolidays`) and
///     half-days or special sessions (`setSpecialSessions`). An override REPLACES the weekday mask
///     for that day, which is how a special Saturday auction is scheduled.
///
/// THERE IS NO TIMEZONE AND NO DAYLIGHT SAVING. UTC does not observe DST; a venue that does will
/// shift by an hour twice a year relative to any fixed UTC window, and the schedule must be
/// re-cut when it does. `setSessionHours` exists for exactly that and is available to the issuer
/// without governance delay. An issuer who forgets will run an hour early or an hour late - which
/// is a visible, self-correcting error, unlike the alternative of encoding a DST table on-chain
/// and being wrong about a future rule change nobody can amend.
///
/// #####################################################################################
/// ############################ 2. THE HALT ############################
/// #####################################################################################
///
/// Three roles, deliberately asymmetric, following the guardian pattern used elsewhere in this
/// repository: a role may be handed the power to make the market MORE restricted without
/// governance delay; making it LESS restricted is the slower path.
///
///   * `guardian` (global, owner-set) - may ONLY `halt`. It cannot resume, cannot touch the
///     calendar, cannot touch the oracle, and cannot touch the band. A compromised guardian can
///     stop trading in every pool on this hook, which is visible, reversible by the issuer or the
///     owner, and costs nobody their funds. That asymmetry is what makes it safe to hand this to a
///     fast-moving incident desk or a keeper watching a feed.
///
///   * `issuer` (per-pool, owner-set) - runs the market day to day: `halt`, `resume`,
///     `setSessionHours`, `setHolidays`, `setSpecialSessions`, `clearDayOverrides`. It CANNOT
///     change the oracle, the band widths, the staleness window, or who the issuer is.
///
///   * owner - governance. Everything, including `configureMarket`, which is the only way the
///     oracle, the bands and the issuer address move.
///
/// `halt` is instant and takes no argument that could fail. `resume` requires the issuer or the
/// owner. That is the "one-way-ish" part: the fast key only ever stops things.
///
/// #####################################################################################
/// ############################ 3. THE PRICE BAND ############################
/// #####################################################################################
///
/// Enforced in `afterSwap`, against the price the pool ACTUALLY ENDED AT, because that is the only
/// place the resulting print is knowable. The rule is a pure function of two things - the
/// post-swap price and the swap's direction - and it is:
///
///     A swap may not leave the pool priced outside the band, UNLESS it moved the price TOWARD
///     the band. `zeroForOne` decreases `sqrtPriceX96`; `!zeroForOne` increases it.
///
///       post above the upper edge + price-increasing swap  -> REJECT (a divergent print)
///       post above the upper edge + price-decreasing swap  -> ALLOW  (converging: pre >= post)
///       post below the lower edge + price-decreasing swap  -> REJECT
///       post below the lower edge + price-increasing swap  -> ALLOW  (converging)
///       post inside the band                               -> ALLOW
///
/// The exception is not a loophole, it is the thing that makes the control usable. A tokenized
/// equity gaps overnight: the reference moves while the pool sits where it closed. Without the
/// converging exception, the pool wakes up outside its own band and EVERY swap reverts, including
/// the arbitrage that would bring it back - a permanent, unrecoverable lockout caused by the
/// safety control itself. Because an AMM's price is monotone in the swap direction, a converging
/// swap can never end further from the band than it started, so permitting it cannot be used to
/// print a worse price than the pool already showed.
///
/// WHAT THE BAND DOES NOT DO, STATED PLAINLY:
///
///   * It does not bound the price of EVERY trade inside a swap, only the price the swap ends at.
///     A single large swap can start at the lower edge and end at the upper edge, executing
///     through the whole band on the way. Bounding execution is what `sqrtPriceLimitX96` and
///     `PermissionedPoolHook.maxSwapPerTx` are for; use them together with this.
///   * It does not stop the price being wrong. It stops the pool PRINTING further wrong. If the
///     reference oracle is wrong, the band is wrong in exactly the same direction.
///   * It is not a stop on cross-venue arbitrage, a last-look, or a minimum quote life.
///
/// FAILURE IS CLOSED. If the oracle reverts, exceeds its gas budget, is not a contract, returns
/// the wrong number of bytes, returns a zero price, or returns a price older than `maxPriceAge`,
/// the swap REVERTS. Losing the reference price is a reason to stop trading, not a reason to trade
/// unbounded. The corollary an issuer must accept: AN ORACLE OUTAGE HALTS THE POOL. The band is
/// therefore opt-in per pool (`bandEnabled`), and the oracle should be operated with that in mind.
///
/// LIQUIDITY IS NEVER TRAPPED BY THIS MODULE. Nothing here touches the removal path. A halt, a
/// closed session and a dead price oracle all leave `beforeRemoveLiquidity` exactly as the hook
/// that mixes this in left it - which in `PermissionedPoolHook`'s case is deliberately open. A
/// control that can confiscate LP capital by being switched on is not a control anyone should
/// ship.
