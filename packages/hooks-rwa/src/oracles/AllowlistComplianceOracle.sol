/// @title AllowlistComplianceOracle
/// @notice A minimal, self-custodied `IComplianceOracle`: an on-chain register of accounts an
/// issuer's off-chain KYC process has cleared, with an expiry and a jurisdiction per account.
///
/// @dev ############################ WHAT THIS IS FOR ############################
///
/// This is the REFERENCE implementation and the fallback for an issuer who runs their own
/// investor onboarding and simply needs somewhere to publish the result. It is intentionally the
/// dumbest thing that can work: a mapping, an owner, and events.
///
/// It is not a KYC provider, it does not verify anything, and it makes no assertion about whether
/// its contents reflect reality. It reports what its owner wrote into it. An issuer with a real
/// attestation provider should point the hook at THAT provider's contract instead - the whole
/// point of `IComplianceOracle` being an interface is that this contract is replaceable.
///
/// Nothing here is legal advice, and the existence of an entry in this register is not a
/// determination that any trade it enables is lawful anywhere. See `IComplianceOracle`.
///
/// ############################ DESIGN NOTES ############################
///
///  * The whole check is ONE storage read, deliberately. `PermissionedPoolHook` calls this inside
///    a Vault lock under a hard gas cap; an implementation that loops, or that calls out to a
///    registry which loops, gets denied by that cap and takes the pool's trading with it.
///
///  * `poolId` and `action` are accepted and ignored. This register is global to the issuer. An
///    implementation that needs per-offering or per-action rules should branch on them; the
///    parameters exist in the interface so that it can.
///
///  * Records are never deleted, only set to `permitted = false`. An empty slot and a revoked slot
///    would otherwise be indistinguishable on-chain, and revocation is the more important of the
///    two events to be able to prove after the fact.
///
///  * `expiresAt` is enforced by the CONSUMER (the hook), not here. This contract reports the
///    expiry it was given and lets the caller decide what staleness means. That keeps the answer
///    to "what did the register say" independent of when it was asked.
///
///  * Ownership is `Ownable2Step`. On mainnet the owner should be a timelock or multisig - see
///    `packages/governance/src/LatchTimelock.sol`. Note the timelock delay applies to REVOCATIONS
///    too, which is a real trade-off for a sanctions response; an issuer who needs immediate
///    revocation should keep a fast-path denial in the hook's own denylist, which is separate.
