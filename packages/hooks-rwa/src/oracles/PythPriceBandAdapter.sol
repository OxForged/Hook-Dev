/// @title PythPriceBandAdapter
/// @notice An `IPriceBandOracle` backed by a Pyth price feed, for pools trading a tokenized
/// real-world asset against a stablecoin.
///
/// @dev ####################### WHY THIS IS TWO CALLS, NOT ONE #######################
///
/// Pyth is PULL-based: a price only exists on chain once somebody submits a signed update, and
/// `updatePriceFeeds` is `payable` and state-changing. `IPriceBandOracle.referencePrice` is
/// required to be `view` — the consumer reaches it by `staticcall` from inside a Vault lock, and
/// any state write reverts the call and reads as "unavailable".
///
/// So this adapter cannot pull. It splits the work:
///
///   `refresh(poolId)`     PERMISSIONLESS. Reads whatever Pyth currently holds, converts it into
///                         the pool's units, and caches the result. Does the expensive `sqrt`.
///   `referencePrice()`    `view`, one SLOAD of a single packed slot. What every swap pays for.
///
/// This is exactly what the interface's own note prescribes: "An adapter computes it once per feed
/// update instead" of making every trader pay for a rescale and a square root.
///
/// Posting the Pyth update itself is deliberately NOT this contract's job. A keeper posts to Pyth
/// and then calls `refresh`; keeping the two separate means this contract never holds a balance,
/// never forwards value, and cannot be drained of an update fee.
///
/// ####################### THE UNIT. THIS IS THE PART THAT GOES WRONG. #######################
///
/// The interface warns that getting this backwards INVERTS THE BAND — the consumer would then
/// reject every swap in one direction and permit any swap in the other. The conversion here is
/// therefore written out longhand rather than compressed.
///
/// Pyth reports a HUMAN price: `price * 10**expo` units of the quote asset per ONE whole unit of
/// the base asset. Example: AAPL/USD at `price = 18_950_000_000, expo = -8` is $189.50.
///
/// The pool wants `sqrt(currency1 smallest-units per ONE currency0 smallest-unit) * 2**96`, which
/// depends on BOTH tokens' decimals AND on which of the two sorted lower. Two cases:
///
///   baseIsCurrency0 == true   (the RWA token sorted below the stablecoin)
///       currency1 per currency0 = price * 10**expo * 10**quoteDecimals / 10**baseDecimals
///
///   baseIsCurrency0 == false  (the stablecoin sorted below the RWA token)
///       the ratio is the RECIPROCAL of the above.
///
/// Both are expressed below as an exact rational `num / den`, and the square root is taken once, on
/// `num * 2**192 / den` (or `num * 2**126 / den` for ratios at or above `2**64`; see
/// `_toSqrtPriceX96`), so there is no intermediate rounding of the price itself.
///
/// ####################### FAILURE IS A VALID ANSWER #######################
///
/// Rule 4 of the interface: reverting means "no reference price", and the consumer treats that as
/// a reason to STOP TRADING. Every rejection below is therefore deliberate, and every one of them
/// halts the pool rather than letting an unverified price through:
///
///   * no feed configured for this pool
///   * Pyth's price is not strictly positive
///   * Pyth's publish time is older than `maxPublishAge`
///   * the confidence interval is wider than `maxConfBps` of the price
///   * the converted price falls outside the range core can represent (`PriceOutOfRange`, or
///     `RatioUnrepresentable` when the ratio is too large even to compute)
///
/// The first four are checked in `refresh`, so a bad feed never reaches the cache. The consumer
/// separately rejects a cache that has gone stale, because `referencePrice` reports Pyth's own
/// publish time and not the time `refresh` happened to run.
