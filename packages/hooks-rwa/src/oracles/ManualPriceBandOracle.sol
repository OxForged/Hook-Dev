/// @title ManualPriceBandOracle
/// @notice A minimal, self-custodied `IPriceBandOracle`: a reference price per pool, published
/// on-chain by the issuer or by keepers the issuer designates.
///
/// @dev ############################ WHAT THIS IS FOR ############################
///
/// This is the REFERENCE implementation and the fallback for an issuer who already knows what the
/// asset is worth - because a transfer agent, a fund administrator, a primary venue or their own
/// market-making desk tells them - and simply needs somewhere to publish it. It is deliberately
/// the dumbest thing that can work: a mapping, an owner, a publisher set, and events.
///
/// It verifies nothing. It reports what its publishers wrote into it. An issuer with a real feed
/// should write a thin adapter that implements `IPriceBandOracle` over that feed instead - the
/// whole point of the interface is that this contract is replaceable.
///
/// Nothing here is legal advice, and a price published here is not a valuation, a NAV, a mark, an
/// official closing price, or a representation that any trade near it is fair or lawful. See
/// `IPriceBandOracle`.
///
/// ####################### THE UNIT. GET THIS WRONG AND THE BAND INVERTS. #######################
///
/// `sqrtPriceX96` is in the POOL's units:
///
///     sqrt(currency1 per 1 currency0, each in its own smallest unit) * 2**96
///
/// The same number `ICLPoolManager.getSlot0` returns. It is not a USD price and it depends on
/// which of the pair's two tokens sorted lower. A publisher converting from a human price must do
/// the decimals and the ordering itself; the safest way to confirm is to read the live pool's
/// `getSlot0` and check the published value is the same order of magnitude.
///
/// This contract cannot check that for you - it does not know the pool's tokens - so it applies
/// the only check it can: the value must be inside the range core can represent at all.
///
/// ############################ DESIGN NOTES ############################
///
///  * The whole read is ONE storage slot, deliberately. `MarketHoursModule` calls this inside a
///    Vault lock under a hard gas cap; an implementation that loops, or that calls out to
///    something that loops, gets denied by that cap and takes the pool's trading with it.
///
///  * `updatedAt` is stamped by this contract, not supplied by the publisher, so a stale price
///    cannot be re-dated without re-publishing it. The consumer enforces its own staleness window
///    against that stamp.
///
///  * `clearReference` publishes "no price", which the consumer reads as oracle-unavailable and
///    which therefore STOPS TRADING on any pool whose band is enabled. That is a halt lever
///    reachable from the feed side, and it should be understood as one: a publisher key is a key
///    that can stop the market. It cannot start one that the calendar or a halt has stopped, and
///    it can never block an LP exit.
///
///  * A PUBLISHER KEY ALSO MOVES THE BAND, and that is the more dangerous power of the two.
///    `MarketHoursModule` defines the band as a ratio to whatever this contract reports, so
///    whoever moves the reference moves the band with it. Unbounded, that makes the publisher
///    role a complete bypass of the price band rather than a feed into it: set the reference
///    high enough and the swap the band refused a block ago is suddenly "in band".
///
///    Every other fast key in this design only ever RESTRICTS - a guardian may halt but not
///    resume, an issuer may close a day but cannot touch the widths. The publisher is the one
///    fast key that LOOSENS, so it is the one that needs a bound.
///
///    `maxPublisherDeviationBps` is that bound: a publisher may move a pool's reference by at
///    most that much, in PRICE terms, measured against `anchor` - the last non-zero price, which
///    survives `clearReference` precisely so that clearing is not a way around it. Beyond the
///    bound the move belongs to the owner, which on a live chain is a timelock.
///
///    Be clear about what this does and does not buy. It does NOT make a compromised publisher
///    harmless: a key that may move 10% per update, with no interval configured, can still walk
///    the reference anywhere over enough transactions. What it buys is TIME and VISIBILITY - the
///    walk is bounded per step, every step emits `ReferencePriceSet`, and the owner can revoke
///    the key or re-anchor while it is happening. Set `minPublisherInterval` on a live deployment
///    to make the walk slow enough to actually respond to; the default of 0 does not.
///
///  * Ownership is `Ownable2Step`, and on a live chain the owner should be a timelock or multisig.
///    Publishers are deliberately NOT timelocked - a reference price that arrives six hours late
///    is not a reference price - which is why the publisher role can only write prices, cannot
///    appoint anyone, and cannot move a price further than the owner has allowed.
