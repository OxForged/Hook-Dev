/// @title ChainlinkPriceBandAdapter
/// @notice An `IPriceBandOracle` backed by a Chainlink `AggregatorV3` feed, for pools trading a
/// tokenized real-world asset against a stablecoin. The push-based sibling of
/// `PythPriceBandAdapter`.
///
/// @dev ####################### WHY THIS IS STILL TWO CALLS #######################
///
/// Chainlink is PUSH-based: the price already exists on chain and `latestRoundData` is a `view`, so
/// unlike the Pyth sibling nothing here is forced to split the work by mutability. It is split
/// anyway, for the reason the interface itself gives:
///
///   `refresh(poolId)`    PERMISSIONLESS. Reads the aggregator, validates the round, converts to
///                        the pool's units — the rescale and the square root — and caches it.
///   `referencePrice()`   `view`. Two SLOADs, one bounded staticcall to the sequencer feed when
///                        one is configured, and no arithmetic beyond a comparison.
///
/// A swap that had to rescale a feed answer and take a 256-bit square root inside the Vault lock
/// would pay for it on every trade, and would do so under `MarketHoursModule`'s hard
/// `PRICE_ORACLE_GAS_LIMIT` — a budget an unbounded aggregator proxy chain could plausibly blow,
/// which would read as "oracle unavailable" and halt the pool for a reason that has nothing to do
/// with the price. The conversion happens once per feed update instead, exactly as the interface
/// prescribes.
///
/// `refresh` is permissionless because the keeper package is permissionless by design (CLAUDE.md
/// § Automation): a privileged refresh makes the pool's ability to trade a liveness dependency on
/// one key, and a stolen key that can only refresh buys an attacker nothing. The caller supplies no
/// price and cannot influence the result — every input comes from the aggregator and from
/// owner-set configuration.
///
/// ####################### THE UNIT. THIS IS THE PART THAT GOES WRONG. #######################
///
/// The interface warns that getting this backwards INVERTS THE BAND: the consumer would read a
/// pool trading at fair value as wildly off it, reject every swap in one direction, and permit any
/// swap in the other. The conversion is therefore written out longhand.
///
/// Chainlink reports a HUMAN price: `answer / 10**feedDecimals` units of the quote asset per ONE
/// WHOLE unit of the base asset. `AAPL/USD` at `answer = 18_950_000_000, decimals = 8` is $189.50.
///
/// The pool wants
///
///     sqrtPriceX96 = sqrt(currency1 smallest-units per ONE currency0 smallest-unit) * 2**96
///
/// which depends on BOTH tokens' decimals AND on which of the two sorted lower:
///
///   baseIsCurrency0 == true    (the RWA token sorted below the stablecoin)
///       R = answer * 10**quoteDecimals / (10**feedDecimals * 10**baseDecimals)
///
///   baseIsCurrency0 == false   (the stablecoin sorted below the RWA token)
///       R = the RECIPROCAL of the above.
///
/// Both are carried as an exact rational `num / den` and inverted by SWAPPING the two, so the price
/// itself is never rounded before the single square root at the end.
///
/// ####################### THE L2 SEQUENCER #######################
///
/// Chainlink's documented guidance for L2s is that a price read must also consult the chain's
/// sequencer-uptime feed and refuse prices published while the sequencer was down, or within a
/// grace period of it coming back. The hazard is the restart: transactions queued during an outage
/// all execute in a burst against a reference nobody was able to update.
///
/// Note carefully that the cache's own staleness does NOT cover this. An outage shorter than a
/// feed's `heartbeat` leaves the cached reference looking perfectly fresh at restart, and the
/// burst trades against it. That is precisely the window the grace period exists for, and it is why
/// the check is applied in `referencePrice` and not only in `refresh`.
///
/// `sequencerUptimeFeed` is an immutable constructor argument and MAY be `address(0)`:
///
///   * SET      — enforced in both `refresh` and `referencePrice`. A down sequencer, an
///                uninitialised uptime round, an uptime feed that reverts or returns the wrong
///                shape, or a recovery inside `sequencerGracePeriod` all read as no reference
///                price, and the consumer halts the pool.
///
///   * ZERO     — THE CHECK IS ABSENT AND THIS CONTRACT SAYS SO OUT LOUD. The constructor emits
///                `SequencerCheckAbsent`, `sequencerCheckEnabled()` returns false, and this
///                paragraph is the warning: on an L2 deployed without an uptime feed, A SEQUENCER
///                RESTART CAN BE TRADED THROUGH. A burst of queued swaps will execute against
///                whatever reference was last cached, and the only thing standing between them and
///                a stale price is the feed's `heartbeat`. Do not read "not configured" as
///                "the sequencer is up" — nothing here has checked.
///
///                This is not a hypothetical default. At the time of writing, no sequencer-uptime
///                feed is published for Robinhood Chain by either Chainlink or the chain operator,
///                so a deployment there MUST pass zero and MUST compensate with a `heartbeat`
///                short enough that an outage of operational significance ages the cache out.
///
/// The feed is immutable rather than owner-settable on purpose. It is the one parameter whose
/// removal LOOSENS the contract, and a setter would hand the owner a one-transaction way to
/// disable a safety check. Repointing is cheap by other means: this adapter holds no funds and no
/// history, and `MarketHoursModule` names its oracle in per-pool settings, so adopting an uptime
/// feed that gets published later is a redeploy and a config change, not a migration.
///
/// ####################### FAILURE IS A VALID ANSWER #######################
///
/// Rule 4 of the interface: no reference price means STOP TRADING, never "skip the check". The two
/// halves fail in opposite styles, both closed:
///
///   `refresh`         REVERTS, with a named error, and caches nothing. A revert is a free read
///                     for a keeper that simulates before it sends (CLAUDE.md § Automation), and
///                     it leaves the previous cache in place rather than zeroing it — the previous
///                     price then ages out on its own `heartbeat`.
///
///   `referencePrice`  NEVER REVERTS. It returns `(0, 0)` for: no feed configured, nothing ever
///                     cached, a cached answer older than the feed's `heartbeat`, and — when an
///                     uptime feed is configured — a sequencer that is down, inside its grace
///                     period, or unreadable. `(0, 0)` is what the consumer treats as unavailable.
///                     Returning rather than reverting costs the consumer nothing (it reads a
///                     revert the same way) and makes this contract usable from any other reader
///                     without a try/catch.
///
/// `updatedAt` is THE FEED'S OWN round timestamp, never `block.timestamp` and never the moment
/// `refresh` ran. That is what makes a stale cache detectable by the consumer's own staleness
/// window, and it is what makes the whole arrangement fail closed: if nobody refreshes, the number
/// ages, the consumer rejects it, and trading halts. A cache refreshed one second ago from an
/// hour-old round is an hour-old price and must report itself as one.
///
/// ####################### ROUNDING #######################
///
/// Every step rounds DOWN (`Math.mulDiv` and `Math.sqrt` both floor), so the reference is at most
/// one unit of `sqrtPriceX96` below the exact value. See `_toSqrtPriceX96` for why that is the
/// right choice and how small the resulting error is.
///
/// ####################### WHAT THIS IS NOT #######################
///
/// Nothing here is legal advice, and a price cached here is not a valuation, a NAV, a mark, an
/// official closing price, or a representation that any trade near it is fair or lawful. A
/// Chainlink feed is a third party this contract cannot audit; pointing a pool at one is a trust
/// decision, which is why it is `onlyOwner`. See `IPriceBandOracle`.

    ///     one unit low shifts the whole band down by one unit: the upper edge tightens by
    ///     the same amount the lower edge loosens. The failure a band must not have is a rounding
    ///     rule that widens BOTH edges, and flooring a single value cannot do that. The consumer
