///
///   1. This package sits under a GPL-2.0-or-later licence and a build with two pinned transient
///      backends. Adding a third-party Solidity dependency for two function selectors is cost
///      without benefit.
///   2. The adapter's whole security posture is that it can only ask Pyth the questions listed
///      here. A narrow interface IS the allowlist.
///
/// The struct layout and both signatures match Pyth's published `IPyth`/`PythStructs` exactly; a
/// mismatch would revert at decode time rather than return a wrong number, because the adapter
/// checks nothing about the shape and Solidity's ABI decoder does.

    ///        Pyth saying "the market disagrees with itself right now" — the adapter treats that
    ///        as a reason to withhold a reference, not a detail to average away.
