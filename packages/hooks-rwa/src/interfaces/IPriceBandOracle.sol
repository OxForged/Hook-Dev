/// @dev ############################ IMPLEMENTER'S CONTRACT ############################
///
/// The consumer calls this from inside `afterSwap`, i.e. inside a Vault lock, on the critical path
/// of every trade. The same four rules that govern `IComplianceOracle` govern this, for the same
/// reasons, and none of them are optional:
///
///   1. `referencePrice` MUST be a `view` and MUST NOT depend on the caller. The consumer queries
///      it with a `staticcall`; any state write reverts the call and reads as "unavailable".
///
///   2. It MUST fit inside `MarketHoursModule.PRICE_ORACLE_GAS_LIMIT`. The consumer caps the gas it
///      forwards so a broken or hostile feed cannot consume the whole transaction. An oracle that
///      exceeds that budget reads as unavailable and the swap is rejected. Do not iterate unbounded
///      arrays; do not call out to contracts that might.
///
///   3. The return MUST be exactly the two values below, ABI-encoded (64 bytes). The consumer
///      checks `returndatasize` and rejects anything else, which is also what defeats a
///      return-data bomb. Adding a field makes this a DIFFERENT interface - write an adapter.
///
///   4. Reverting is a legitimate answer and means "no reference price". The consumer treats that
///      as a reason to STOP TRADING, not as a reason to skip the check. A circuit breaker whose
///      failure mode is "let every price through" is not a circuit breaker.
///
/// ###################### THE UNIT. THIS IS THE PART THAT GOES WRONG. ######################
///
/// `sqrtPriceX96` is in the POOL's units, not the feed's: it is
///
///     sqrt(amount of currency1 per 1 unit of currency0, in each token's own smallest unit) * 2**96
///
/// exactly as core stores it in `CLPool.slot0`. It is NOT a USD price, NOT 8-decimal Chainlink
/// scale, and NOT independent of which token sorted lower.
///
/// That conversion is deliberately pushed into the implementation, because the implementation is
/// the only party that knows both the feed's decimals and the pool's token ordering, and because
/// an on-chain `sqrt` of a rescaled feed value on the swap hot path is an expense every trader
/// would pay on every trade. An adapter computes it once per feed update instead.
///
/// GETTING THIS BACKWARDS INVERTS THE BAND. If an implementation returns the reciprocal price, the
/// consumer will read a pool trading at fair value as being wildly off it, and will reject every
/// swap in one direction while permitting any swap in the other. Test an adapter against a real
/// pool's `getSlot0` output before it governs anything.
///
/// ############################ WHAT THIS IS NOT ############################
///
/// Nothing here is legal advice, and nothing here asserts that any band width, any reference
/// source, or any resulting trading behaviour satisfies any market-structure rule, exchange
/// obligation, best-execution duty or price-discovery requirement in any jurisdiction. This is a
/// mechanism for asking a contract what price it thinks something is worth. What an issuer is
/// obliged to do with that answer is a question for the issuer's counsel.
/// ##########################################################################
