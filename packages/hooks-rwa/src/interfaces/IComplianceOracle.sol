/// @dev ############################ IMPLEMENTER'S CONTRACT ############################
///
/// This interface is deliberately tiny and deliberately a `view`. The hook calls it inside
/// `beforeSwap` and `beforeAddLiquidity`, i.e. inside a Vault lock, on the critical path of every
/// trade. Four rules follow and none of them are optional:
///
///   1. `checkCompliance` MUST be a `view` and MUST NOT depend on the caller. The hook queries it
///      with a `staticcall`, so any state write reverts the call and the hook will treat that as
///      "oracle unavailable" and DENY the trade.
///
///   2. `checkCompliance` MUST fit inside `PermissionedPoolHook.ORACLE_GAS_LIMIT`. The hook caps
///      the gas it forwards precisely so a broken or malicious oracle cannot consume the whole
///      transaction. An oracle that runs out of that budget reads as unavailable, and the trade is
///      denied. Do not iterate unbounded arrays; do not call out to further contracts that might.
///
///   3. The return MUST be exactly the three values below, ABI-encoded (96 bytes). The hook checks
///      `returndatasize` and rejects anything else, which also defeats a return-data bomb. If you
///      add a field, you have made a DIFFERENT interface - deploy an adapter, do not widen this.
///
///   4. Reverting is a legitimate answer, but understand what it means: the hook fails CLOSED for
///      trading and for adding liquidity. It never fails closed for REMOVING liquidity - exits do
///      not consult this oracle at all. See the hook's contract-level documentation.
///
/// ############################ WHAT THIS IS NOT ############################
///
/// Nothing here constitutes legal advice, and nothing here asserts that any particular oracle
/// implementation, or any configuration of the hook that consumes it, satisfies any securities
/// law, sanctions regime, transfer-agent rule or exchange registration requirement in any
/// jurisdiction. That determination is for the issuer's counsel. This interface is a mechanism for
/// asking an address-shaped question and receiving an address-shaped answer.
