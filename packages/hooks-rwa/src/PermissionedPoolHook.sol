/// @title PermissionedPoolHook
/// @notice A compliance-gated CL pool for tokenized real-world assets: every swap and every

///
/// @dev ################### NO LEGAL ADVICE IS GIVEN OR IMPLIED ###################
///
/// This contract is a MECHANISM. It gates pool operations on the answer an issuer-chosen oracle
/// gives about an issuer-chosen identity. Whether any particular configuration of it satisfies any
/// particular securities law, sanctions regime, transfer-agent obligation, exchange-registration
/// requirement, or investor-suitability rule in any jurisdiction is a question for the issuer's
/// counsel. It is not answered here, it is not answered by the code, and no statement in this
/// repository should be read as answering it.
///
/// #####################################################################################
/// ############ THE CONSTRAINT THAT DETERMINES THIS ENTIRE DESIGN ############
/// #####################################################################################
///
///   THE `sender` ARGUMENT OF EVERY HOOK CALLBACK IS THE VAULT LOCKER, NOT THE END USER.
///
/// `CLHooks.beforeSwap` invokes this hook with `abi.encodeCall(ICLHooks.beforeSwap, (msg.sender,
/// key, params, hookData))`, where `msg.sender` is whoever locked the Vault - the router. Every
/// swap routed through one shared router arrives with the SAME `sender`. And `hookData` is
/// arbitrary attacker-controlled calldata, because anybody may bypass a router entirely, lock the
/// Vault themselves and call `poolManager.swap` with whatever bytes they like.
///
/// Therefore the naive compliance hook - "decode a user out of `hookData` and check it against an
/// allowlist" - ENFORCES NOTHING. An unpermitted party simply names a permitted party in their own
/// `hookData` and trades. Shipping that and calling it compliance is worse than shipping nothing,
/// because it manufactures a false assurance.
///
/// ------------------------------ THE MODEL THIS HOOK USES ------------------------------
///
/// TRUSTED-ROUTER ATTESTATION, with an owner-curated router set:
///
///   1. `beforeSwap` and `beforeAddLiquidity` REVERT unless `sender` is in `isTrustedRouter`.
///      `sender` is the one identity in the callback that cannot be forged: it is established by
///      the Vault lock, not supplied as data. Locking the Vault directly, or routing through any
///      contract the owner has not designated, therefore cannot reach the pool at all.
///
///   2. A trusted router places the end user it authenticated into `hookData`, as a bare
///      `abi.encode(address)`. The hook checks THAT account against the denylist, the local
///      allowlist and the compliance oracle.
///
///   3. `beforeRemoveLiquidity` is deliberately NOT gated this way. See "EXIT IS NEVER TRAPPED".
///
/// WHO YOU ARE TRUSTING, STATED PLAINLY:
///
///   * Every address in `isTrustedRouter`, completely. A trusted router can attest any address it
///     likes and the hook will believe it. If a trusted router is malicious, buggy, upgradeable to
///     something malicious, or merely permissionless in a way the issuer did not intend, then the
///     compliance gate on this pool is void. Adding a router to this set is the single
///     highest-consequence action the owner can take. Treat it like `Vault.registerApp`.
///
///   * The compliance oracle, for the accuracy and freshness of its answers.
///
///   * The owner, who controls both of the above.
///
/// THIS DESIGN WAS CHOSEN OVER THE ALTERNATIVES DELIBERATELY:
///
///   * "Gate liquidity only, leave swaps open" is honest but does not produce a permissioned
///     market: anyone could still buy the security. Rejected as insufficient for the stated goal.
///
///   * Token-level enforcement (ERC-1404 / ERC-3643 style, where the RWA token's own `transfer`
///     rejects non-permitted holders) is STRICTLY STRONGER than anything a hook can do, because it
///     binds to custody rather than to a call path. It is not an alternative to this hook, it is
///     the layer this hook should sit on top of. See "USE A PERMISSIONED TOKEN AS WELL" below.
///
/// ------------------------------ WHAT IS ACTUALLY ENFORCED ------------------------------
///
///  * No swap and no liquidity addition can occur except through an owner-designated router.
///    Enforced unconditionally, against the unforgeable `sender`. This is the load-bearing part.
///  * For every swap and addition, the account the router attests is checked: not on the denylist,
///    and either on the local allowlist or approved by the oracle, with an unexpired attestation,
///    and (optionally) not in a blocked jurisdiction.
///  * A per-pool per-investor cap on cumulative liquidity contributed under one attested identity.
///  * A per-pool cap on the input notional of a single swap.
///  * A global pause that stops trading and additions, and an `enabled` flag per pool.
///  * The pool cannot be initialized at all until the owner has configured it, and cannot be a
///    dynamic-fee pool (this hook returns no fee override, which would leave such a pool at 0 fee).
///
/// ------------------------------ WHAT IS NOT ENFORCED ------------------------------
///
///  * ANYTHING AT ALL, if a trusted router lies. The hook cannot audit its routers. See above.
///  * The identity of the party who ultimately RECEIVES the swap output. The hook sees the pool
///    delta, not the router's internal settlement, so a permitted account can trade on behalf of
///    an unpermitted one. Only the token's own transfer restrictions can close this.
///  * Onward transfer after the trade. Once tokens leave the pool this hook has no further say.
///  * Acquisition through any other venue: another pool (including an unpermissioned pool over the
///    same token pair), an OTC trade, a bridge, or a centralised exchange.
///  * Holder counts, holding periods, lock-ups, cap-table limits, dividend/corporate-action
///    handling, or anything else that is a property of the TOKEN rather than of this pool.
///  * Exit by a denied party through an untrusted route. See below.
///  * Whether the pool's liquidity providers are themselves permitted to be market-makers in a
///    security in their jurisdiction. That is a question about them, not about the pool.
///
/// ------------------------------ EXIT IS NEVER TRAPPED ------------------------------
///
/// A compliance oracle is off-chain infrastructure operated by a third party. It will, at some
/// point, be down, misconfigured, or replaced. The consequences of that must be asymmetric:
///
///   ENTRY FAILS CLOSED.  If the oracle reverts, runs out of the gas budget, returns the wrong
///   number of bytes, or is not a contract, `beforeSwap` and `beforeAddLiquidity` REVERT. A
///   compliance gate whose failure mode is "let everyone in" is not a gate.
///
///   EXIT FAILS OPEN.  `beforeRemoveLiquidity` never calls the oracle, never checks the pause,
///   never checks `enabled`, and never requires a trusted router. Withdrawing is therefore
///   unaffected by oracle downtime, by a pause, by the owner de-trusting a router, or by the owner
///   abandoning the contract entirely.
///
/// The reasoning: withdrawing liquidity cannot be used to ACQUIRE the security from a third party.
/// Core keys a CL position by `(locker, tickLower, tickUpper, salt)`, so an arbitrary caller who
/// locks the Vault directly has no position and can remove nothing. The only thing an open exit
/// path permits is a party recovering assets that are already theirs. Weighed against that, the
/// alternative - an oracle outage or a lapsed owner key permanently confiscating LP capital - is
/// far worse, and it is a failure mode a compliance control should never be able to cause.
///
/// The one exception is deliberate and per-pool: `freezeDeniedExits`. When set, an account on the
/// LOCAL denylist cannot remove liquidity via a trusted router. This is the sanctions-freeze lever.
/// It is PARTIAL BY CONSTRUCTION - it cannot stop the same party exiting through a route the hook
/// cannot identify - and it is a genuine centralisation risk, since the owner can add any address
/// to the denylist. It is off by default.
///
/// Note that a fee collection (`modifyLiquidity` with `liquidityDelta == 0`) is routed by core to
/// `beforeRemoveLiquidity`, so accrued fees are claimable under exactly the same guarantee.
///
/// ------------------------------ USE A PERMISSIONED TOKEN AS WELL ------------------------------
///
/// This hook governs one pool. It does not govern the asset. An issuer who needs the transfer
/// restriction to survive outside this pool must put it in the token (ERC-1404 / ERC-3643 style),
/// at which point the token blocks non-permitted holders everywhere and this hook's job narrows to
/// gating pool ENTRY and enforcing pool-specific limits - which is exactly the division of labour
/// it is designed for. A permissioned pool over an unrestricted token restricts one venue and
/// nothing else.
///
/// ------------------------------ ADMIN ------------------------------
///
/// `Ownable2Step`. On mainnet the owner MUST be `packages/governance/src/LatchTimelock.sol` (or an
/// equivalent multisig + timelock), never an EOA: the owner can change the oracle, change the
/// trusted-router set, and - if `freezeDeniedExits` is on - freeze an LP's exit. Every state change
/// emits an event so the timelock queue and the resulting state are both auditable off-chain.
