/// @title StockPairHook
/// @notice The whole tokenized-equity pair in one hook: `PermissionedPoolHook`'s compliance gate
/// plus `MarketHoursModule`'s trading calendar, halt switch and price band.
///
/// @dev ################### NO LEGAL ADVICE IS GIVEN OR IMPLIED ###################
///
/// This contract is a MECHANISM, and composing two mechanisms does not produce a compliant venue.
/// Read the contract-level notes on BOTH `PermissionedPoolHook` and `MarketHoursModule` before
/// configuring anything: between them they state, at length and deliberately, what is enforced and
/// what is not. Whether any configuration of this hook satisfies any securities law, market-
/// structure rule, exchange-registration requirement or transfer-agent obligation in any
/// jurisdiction is a question for the issuer's counsel. It is not answered here.
///
/// ------------------------------ WHY THIS EXISTS AS ONE CONTRACT ------------------------------
///
/// A pool has exactly ONE hook. An issuer who needs both an identity gate and market hours cannot
/// deploy two hooks and point a pool at both; they must be composed into a single contract, and
/// this is that contract. There is no clever indirection here on purpose: composition through a
/// delegating hook that forwards callbacks to a list of sub-hooks would put an unbounded, owner-
/// mutable call sequence on the swap hot path, and every one of those calls could revert the
/// trade. Inheritance is legible and its gas is knowable.
///
/// ------------------------------ THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS ------------------------------
///
/// `beforeSwap` runs the compliance gate FIRST and the market gate second. That ordering is
/// deliberate and it is about what an observer learns from a revert: an unpermitted party gets
/// `UntrustedLocker` or `AccountNotPermitted` whether or not the market happens to be open, so
/// nobody can use the session boundary to probe the allowlist. It costs nothing, because both
/// paths revert.
///
/// `afterSwap` runs the price band, because the price the swap ends at is the only place the print
/// is knowable. See `MarketHoursModule` for the converging-swap exception and why removing it
/// would lock the pool out of its own band after an overnight gap.
///
/// ------------------------------ EXIT, AGAIN ------------------------------
///
/// This contract does not narrow `PermissionedPoolHook`'s exit guarantee by one line.
/// `_beforeRemoveLiquidity` is inherited unchanged: no oracle, no pause, no calendar, no halt, no
/// trusted-router requirement. A halted market, a closed session, a dead price oracle and a dead
/// compliance oracle all leave withdrawal working. The only thing that can refuse an exit remains
/// `freezeDeniedExits` on a locally denylisted account, exactly as documented there.
///
/// Adding a market-hours check to the exit path would mean an issuer could trap LP capital by
/// halting, and no safety control should be able to do that.
///
/// ------------------------------ ADMIN ------------------------------
///
/// Two seats, and they are not the same seat:
///
///   * `owner` (`Ownable2Step`) - governance. Owns the compliance configuration, the trusted-router
///     set, the allow/denylists, the global pause, the compliance oracle, the price oracle, the
///     band widths, the guardian, and who each pool's issuer is. MUST be a timelock or multisig on
///     any chain holding real funds.
///
///   * `issuer` (per pool) and `marketGuardian` (global) - the fast, deliberately weaker seats,
///     which can halt and re-cut the calendar but cannot touch identity, oracles or bands. See the
///     role note in `MarketHoursModule`.
