/// @dev THE ATTACK `PermissionedPoolHook` EXISTS TO STOP.
///
/// Nothing about locking the Vault is privileged: `IVault.lock` is callable by anybody, and
/// whoever calls it becomes the `sender` every hook callback sees for the duration. So an
/// unpermitted party does not need a router's cooperation to reach the pool - they can lock the
/// Vault themselves and call `poolManager.swap` directly with `hookData` of their own choosing.
///
/// This contract does exactly that, and names a PERMITTED investor in its `hookData`. Against the
/// naive design - "decode an account out of `hookData` and check it against an allowlist" - this
/// trades successfully, because the forged attestation is indistinguishable from a real one.
/// Against the trusted-router design it cannot get past `beforeSwap`, because `sender` is this
/// contract and this contract is not in `isTrustedRouter`.
///
/// The settlement half is deliberately absent: the swap is expected to revert inside the hook
/// callback, long before any delta needs settling. If the hook's gate ever regressed, the test
/// asserting on the revert would fail loudly rather than silently passing on an unsettled lock.
