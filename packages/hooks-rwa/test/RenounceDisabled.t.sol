/// from memory — so a new one added without the override has an obvious place to be caught.

///   1. renouncing reverts `RenounceDisabled()` for the owner, and for anyone else;
///   2. ownership survives the attempt;
///   3. the legitimate route, `transferOwnership` + `acceptOwnership`, still works and is two-step;

///      cannot renounce either.

/// zero, and step 1's `expectRevert` is not met.
