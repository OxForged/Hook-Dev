/**
 * Points `PythPriceBandAdapter` at the REAL Pyth contract on Ethereum Sepolia.
 *
 * ############################ WHAT THIS PROVES ############################
 *
 * The adapter has 17 passing unit tests, all against a mock. This runs it against the live
 * Pyth deployment, which behaves in one way no mock would have suggested:
 *
 *   THE SEPOLIA FEEDS ARE STALE. Pyth is pull-based, so a price only exists on chain once
 *   somebody pays to post it — and on a testnet nobody does. ETH/USD was last published
 *   more than a week ago at the time this was written.
 *
 * That is not a problem to work around; it is the single most important thing to verify.
 * A price-band oracle whose failure mode is "let a week-old price through" is not a
 * circuit breaker. So the script asserts the adapter REJECTS it, and only then relaxes
 * `maxPublishAge` to prove the conversion math is right on the same real data.
 *
 * Run:
 *   forge script script/ExercisePythSepolia.s.sol:ExercisePythSepolia \
 *     --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com --broadcast --slow -vv
