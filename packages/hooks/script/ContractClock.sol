 * ###################### THE CONTRACT CLOCK, CHECKED AT DEPLOY TIME ######################
 *
 * HISTORY, kept because it is why this file exists. Latch contracts used to turn durations into
 * `block.number` counts through a `blockTimeCentis` constructor argument. On Robinhood Chain (4663,
 * Arbitrum Nitro) that argument was set to 10 (0.1 s), the RPC's L2 block time, while `block.number`
 * INSIDE THE EVM is Ethereum's ~12 s block. Every window ran ~120x long. This file then measured
 * NUMBER against TIMESTAMP over a three-minute wait and refused a wrong declaration.
 *
 * DECIDED 2026-09-13 (Option B): every duration moved to `block.timestamp`. No contract takes a
 * block time any more, so there is nothing left to declare wrongly and the cadence measurement is
 * gone. What remains is the check a TIMESTAMP-based deployment actually needs:
 *
 *   IS THE EVM'S `block.timestamp` REAL TIME?
 *
 * Asked the same way as before, by running `CONTRACT_CLOCK_PROBE` as a contract-creation `eth_call`,
 * which returns `(NUMBER, TIMESTAMP)` exactly as a contract at `latest` sees them. It is compared
 * against two independent references:
 *
 *   1. the RPC header time of the block the script forked (`block.timestamp` in the script), which
 *      catches a probe answered from different state than the fork - a load-balanced RPC whose
 *      backends disagree, or an archive node serving a stale head;
 *   2. the operator's own wall clock (`vm.unixTime`), which catches a chain whose clock is not
 *      tracking real time. On Nitro the sequencer may run up to 24 h BEHIND real time (after an
 *      outage, while it catches up) or 1 h AHEAD. Deploying time-bounded contracts into either
 *      state means the post-deploy assertions and the fork rehearsal describe a world that is about
 *      to shift underneath them.
 *
 * Both are refusals, not warnings. A deployment that trips one waits and reruns; nothing about a
 * correct deployment is urgent enough to ship into a clock that is visibly off.
 *
 * `ContractClockMath` is pure and unit-tested with mutation checks in
 * `test/script/ContractClockMath.t.sol`. `ContractClockProbe` is the RPC half and only runs inside
 * `forge script --rpc-url`.
