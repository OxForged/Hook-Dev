   Guards on the address book.

   An address table cannot be unit-tested for correctness — only the chain knows
   whether 0x78e8… is the Vault, and `npm run latch:verify` in the scaffolded app
   is what asks it. What CAN be tested is the class of mistake that a human
   editing this file will actually make, and each of those is cheap to catch:

     * a zero-address placeholder sneaking in, which is the one thing the whole
       null-not-zero design exists to prevent;
     * a mistyped or truncated address, which reads as plausible;
     * the same address pasted into two fields, which is how a quoter ends up
       being called as a pool manager;
     * a token listed without decimals, or with decimals that disagree with the
       `weth` field pointing at it — the 10^12 mispricing trap;
     * a reference pool whose tokens are not in the token table, so a consumer
       has an address and no way to scale its amounts;
     * `REDEPLOYABLE_CONTRACTS` naming a field that no longer exists after a
       rename, which would silently stop warning about anything.

   Nothing here reaches the network. These are assertions about a source file.
