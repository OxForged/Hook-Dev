/**
 * Emits the ABIs a DEX front end encodes calldata against: the router, the
 * quoter and the position manager.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the SDK shipped an address book that named
 * `universalRouter`, `clQuoter` and `clPositionManager`, and no way to call any
 * of them. Every ABI the package exported was either an EVENT ABI (for
 * indexing) or the registry and launchpad. So an integrator was told exactly
 * where the three contracts they need are, and then had to fetch their
 * interfaces from a block explorer and paste them into their own repo.
 *
 * That is worse than it sounds. A pasted ABI is a snapshot with no provenance:
 * nothing says which deployment it came from, nothing fails when the contract
 * is redeployed with a changed signature, and an explorer's "similar contract
 * match" can be a DIFFERENT contract that verifies against the same bytecode
 * hash prefix. The failure mode is a decode that returns a plausible number.
 *
 * Same licence firewall as the other generators: this reads the *ABI JSON* out
 * of the Foundry build artifacts of GPL-licensed Solidity and emits
 * MIT-licensed TypeScript. It never reads Solidity sources, comments or
 * NatSpec, so nothing expressive crosses the boundary — an ABI is a
 * machine-generated interface description.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/generate-trading-abi.mjs [--check]
