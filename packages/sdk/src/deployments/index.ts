   THE LATCH ADDRESS BOOK — one file, every deployed contract, per chain.

   WHY THIS LIVES IN THE SDK AND NOWHERE ELSE
   ------------------------------------------
   An address table is the first thing an integrator needs and the last thing
   they should have to type. Before this module the SDK shipped ABIs, event
   decoders and a probed RPC list but not a single address, so "simple
   integration" still began with hand-copying twenty hex strings out of a
   markdown file — and every consumer that did so became another place the
   truth could rot.

   It had already started. `apps/web/src/lib/chain.ts` carried one copy and
   `packages/create-latch-dex/template/src/config/deployments.ts` a second, and
   the two had ALREADY diverged: the web copy knows the timelocks, the fee
   controller, the quoters and the position descriptor; the template copy does
   not. Neither was wrong, which is exactly the problem — two partial tables
   with no way to tell which one is behind. The DefiLlama adapters in this repo
   went the other way, two hand-maintained mirrors with a parity test bolted on
   to catch drift, and a parity test is a smoke alarm, not a fix. This module is
   the fix: both of those files now RE-EXPORT this one.

   Addresses and ABIs are facts about a public chain, not derivative works of
   the GPL contracts that produced them. Nothing here imports from
   `packages/core`, `periphery`, `router` or any hook package, so a third-party
   hook author can build against this MIT package without ever touching GPL
   code. Every value below was transcribed from `ops/safe/robinhood-deployment
   .md` and `packages/core/script/config/*.json`, both of which record addresses
   READ BACK off chain after deployment rather than copied from a script's log.

   NULL MEANS NOT DEPLOYED. IT NEVER MEANS ZERO.
   ---------------------------------------------
   Every address field that can be absent is typed `Address | null`, and absent
   is written `null`. The zero address is not used as a placeholder anywhere in
   this file and must never be introduced: `0x000...000` is a value a caller
   will happily pass to `readContract`, `getCode` or a swap path, where it
   silently returns empty rather than failing. `null` cannot be called. It
   forces the consumer to branch, which is the whole point — the honest render
   for a contract that does not exist yet is "not configured on this chain",
   not a read against nothing.

   So: `deployment.launchpadKit === null` is a complete, checkable answer.
   `requireContract(deployment, "launchpadKit")` is the other half, for call
   sites that genuinely cannot proceed without it and would rather throw a
   sentence than a stack trace from viem.

   FOUR OF THESE ADDRESSES ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE
   -------------------------------------------
   `LatchRegistry`, `RevShareHook` and the 48h custody timelock are queued for
   redeployment with fixes, and `LatchLaunchRegistry` plus the launchpad pair
   have not landed at all. That is the normal state of an address book, not an
   exception to plan around, so the shape is chosen for it:

     * ONE edit, in ONE file, per redeploy. Nothing downstream restates an
       address; `apps/web` and the `create-latch-dex` template both import.
     * `REDEPLOYABLE_CONTRACTS` names the keys whose address is a moving target,
       because the failure mode of a stale one is silent. A retired
       `LatchRegistry` still answers `latchCount()` with a number and renders as
       a healthy, empty marketplace — see the 2026-09-10 rename, where the old
       registry at 0x665e7e5C… still responds and nothing reads it. A stale
       Vault, by contrast, cannot happen: it is immutable and permanent.

   DECIMALS ARE PART OF THE ADDRESS BOOK, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT
   ----------------------------------------------------------
   USDG is 6 decimals on Robinhood and WETH9 is 18. `sqrtPriceX96` encodes a
   price as a ratio of RAW units, so a hardcoded 18 against a 6-decimal quote is
   wrong by 10^12 — that is a pool opened at a million times the intended price,
   fixed permanently at `initialize`. This repo has already caught that trap
   twice (see the Arc note in `chains/endpoints.ts`, and `lib/swap.ts`). A token
   listed here therefore ALWAYS carries its decimals, and a token whose decimals
   nobody has read off its own contract does not get listed.

   The table is still a claim, not a proof. `decimals()` on the live contract is
   the proof, and anything pricing a pool should read it — `npm run latch:verify`
   in the scaffolded app does exactly that for every address and token here.

   ARC MAINNET (5042) IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
   -----------------------------------------
   It has never answered a probe from this project: TLS handshake failures on
   every candidate endpoint, so chain id 5042 has never been read off a live
   node, and its published USDC decimals contradict themselves (6 in the owner's
   config, 18 on Circle's own Connect page — the 10^12 gap above). See the long
   note in `chains/endpoints.ts`. Do not add it from memory or from a docs page.
   Nothing is deployed there in any case.
