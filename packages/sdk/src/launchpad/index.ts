 * The launchpad.
 *
 * `LaunchpadKit` is the one-call launch factory: it creates the pool, configures
 * the launch-guard hook's fee decay schedule, seeds liquidity and lists the hook
 * in the registry. This module exposes the ABIs needed to encode those calls and
 * to decode the events they emit.
 *
 * `LaunchpadKitV2` (not deployed yet) launches a fresh token into 1..N LOCKED
 * pools - single-sided CL ranges and shaped Bin distributions - in one call. Its
 * helpers live in `./kitV2/`.
 *
 * `./generated/abi.js` is produced by `npm run generate:launchpad` from the
 * compiled artifacts; it is a curated slice, not the full ABI of each contract.
