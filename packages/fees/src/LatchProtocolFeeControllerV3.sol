/// @title LatchProtocolFeeControllerV3
/// @notice Kit launch pools whose liquidity is locked are born paying ZERO core protocol fee,
/// automatically. Every other pool pays exactly what `LatchProtocolFeeControllerV2` says.
///
/// @dev Design of record: `packages/fees/docs/controller-v3.md`. The short version:
///
///     protocolFeeForPool(key) = launchOracle.isLockedLaunch(key.toId()) == true ? 0 : policy.protocolFeeForPool(key)
///
/// COMPOSED OVER THE LIVE V2, NOT A COPY OF IT. `policy` is the deployed V2 instance. Every piece of
/// fee configuration - split ratio, tier and dynamic fees, per-pool overrides, the kill switch and
/// the guardian - stays on V2, under V2's already-tested setters and caps. Nothing is migrated, so
/// nothing can be migrated wrongly. V3 adds only the zero rule and re-provides the four functions
/// core gates on `msg.sender == protocolFeeController`, which V2 loses the moment V3 is installed.
///
/// THE ORACLE IS THE KIT. `launchOracle` must be the LaunchpadKit v2 deployment itself, immutable
/// here. Its word at `initialize` is a promise about the rest of the same transaction ("this pool's
/// position will be in the locker, or this call reverts"), and it is the only party that can make
/// that promise before the pool exists. Neither the launch registry nor the locker can: both
/// records require an initialized pool, and core reads the fee inside `initialize`.
///
/// HOT PATH. Core staticcalls `protocolFeeForPool` inside every pool creation and reverts pool
/// creation if it reverts. So:
///   - the oracle call is gas-capped, copies at most 32 bytes, and treats ANY failure as "not a
///     locked launch" - a broken kit loses the zero rule, never pool creation;
///   - it cannot be gas-starved into a wrong answer: below `LAUNCH_ORACLE_MIN_GASLEFT` it reverts
///     rather than letting EIP-150 hand the kit less than its stipend;
///   - the V2 call is NOT caught. V2 never reverts on any input; if it did, falling back to zero
///     would give whoever caused the failure a zero-fee pool for life. Failing closed is correct.
///   - the oracle can only ever LOWER a pool's fee to zero. It can never raise one.
///
/// OWNERSHIP: the governance Safe (CLAUDE.md ownership table, `LatchProtocolFeeController` owner).
/// No guardian here: V2's guardian still zeroes every non-launch pool through `policy`, and a
/// launch pool is already zero. `renounceOwnership` reverts.
