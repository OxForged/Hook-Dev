/// @notice Decides the protocol fee for every LatchProtocol pool, and is the only address that
/// can withdraw what those fees accrue.
///
/// @dev ####################### WHY V2 EXISTS: THE MONEY WAS UNREACHABLE #######################
///
/// `ProtocolFees.collectProtocolFees` is gated on `msg.sender == protocolFeeController`. V1
/// (`0x2a03E6E6900b9cF93CcC27e3A75a5a95FB4a154c`, live on Robinhood Chain) has twelve external
/// functions and NOT ONE of them calls it — no collect, no sweep, no fallback, no delegatecall.
/// Its deployed bytecode was verified byte-for-byte identical to its source, so this is a fact
/// about the deployment and not a stale reading.
///
/// The consequence: with V1 installed, every pip of protocol fee accrues into
/// `protocolFeesAccrued[currency]` on the pool manager, and the only address permitted to
/// withdraw it is a contract with no code path to do so. The fee was safe to turn on only in the
/// sense that a locked room is safe.
///
/// Nothing accrued under V1 is lost. The caller check is evaluated at COLLECTION time and
/// `protocolFeesAccrued` is ordinary storage on the manager, so installing this contract makes
/// every previously-stranded balance collectable. That is why the ordering of the migration does
/// not matter, and why V1 can be replaced at leisure rather than urgently.
///
/// ############################### THE FEE MODEL CHANGED TOO ################################
///
/// V1 charged a FLAT pip value with per-tier overrides. That is the wrong shape: a flat 0.1% is
/// eleven times the total fee of a 0.01% stable pool and a rounding error on a 1% exotic one, so
/// staying competitive meant hand-maintaining a tier table and hoping no pool opened at a tier
/// nobody had enumerated — such a pool silently fell through to the flat default.
///
/// V2 takes a SHARE of the total swap fee, the way `infinity-core`'s own controller does, so
/// every tier resolves proportionately and an unenumerated tier is impossible.
///
///     protocolFeeSplitRatio = 250000   // 25% of the total swap fee
///
/// PancakeSwap Infinity ships 33% (`ProtocolFeeController.sol:32`, `33 * 1e4`). Latch takes a
/// quarter where they take a third: about 32% fewer pips per swap, because the pip needed to
/// realise a share `s` of the total goes as `s / (1 - s)` rather than linearly in `s`.
///
/// What that means at the tiers that exist:
///
///     LP fee   protocol pips   protocol %   trader pays   protocol share
///     0.01%    33              0.0033%      0.0133%       24.81%
///     0.05%    166             0.0166%      0.0666%       24.92%
///     0.25%    832             0.0832%      0.3330%       24.98%
///     0.30%    999             0.0999%      0.3997%       24.99%
///     1.00%    3322            0.3322%      1.3289%       24.99%
///
/// Two properties worth keeping: 0.30% pools — the common case — land at 0.0999%, and the
/// trader's all-in cost stays under 0.4%. Pancake's 33% hits core's `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE` cap at
/// roughly a 0.9% LP fee, after which their share silently decays (28.65% at 1%, 16.72% at 2%);
/// at 25% we stay under the cap through the 1% tier, so the share is constant and needs no
/// asterisk.
///
/// FEE SEMANTICS, unchanged from V1 and verified in `ProtocolFeeLibrary`: the protocol fee comes
/// off the swap INPUT first and the LP fee applies to the remainder, so it is ADDITIVE to what a
/// swapper pays and does NOT come out of LP earnings:
///
///     totalSwapCost = protocolFee + lpFee - (protocolFee * lpFee / 1_000_000)
///
/// ############################ THE HOT-PATH RULE, INHERITED ################################
///
/// `ProtocolFees._fetchProtocolFee` staticcalls `protocolFeeForPool` while a pool is being
/// INITIALIZED, forwarding all remaining gas and requiring exactly 32 bytes back. If it reverts,
/// returns the wrong size, or burns excessive gas, POOL CREATION FAILS and the protocol is
/// bricked for new pools until the controller is replaced.
///
/// So, as in V1 and for the same reason: `protocolFeeForPool` MUST NOT revert on any input.
/// Every branch returns a value, every division is guarded against a zero denominator, all
/// validation lives in the owner-only setters, and values are clamped on write rather than on
/// read. The split arithmetic below is the one piece V1 did not have, and it is exactly where a
/// division could be introduced carelessly — see `_splitDerivedFee`.
///
/// OWNERSHIP: this contract sets protocol revenue AND moves collected funds, which makes it
/// strictly more valuable than V1. It must be owned by the governance Safe. `Ownable2Step`, and

     * @notice Applied to dynamic-fee pools, which have no static tier to derive a share from.
     *
     * @dev SET BY DEFAULT, AND THAT DEFAULT IS LOAD-BEARING. A dynamic pool's LP fee is chosen
     * per swap by its hook, so at `initialize` there is no total to take a percentage OF — the
     * share model simply has nothing to work with.
     *
     * An earlier draft left this unset and returned zero, on the reasoning that charging a number
     * we cannot derive is worse than charging nothing. That reasoning is sound and the conclusion
     * was still wrong, because of WHICH pools are dynamic here:
     *
     *     LaunchpadKit.sol:373        fee: LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG
     *     LaunchGuardHook.sol:328     if (!key.fee.isDynamicLPFee()) revert PoolMustUseDynamicFee
     *
     * EVERY launchpad pool is dynamic-fee, by construction and by requirement. A zero default
     * therefore exempts the entire launchpad — the protocol's flagship integration path — from
     * the protocol fee, permanently for every pool created that way, since core stamps the fee at
     * `initialize` and never re-reads it.
     *
     * The default is `DYNAMIC_FEE_PIPS`: what a 0.30% pool pays under the split. That is the
     * honest analogue, because 0.30% is exactly what the launch presets DECAY TO —
     * `LaunchPresets.sol` sets `finalFeeBips: 3_000` for FairLaunch, Stealth and NoTax. A launch
     * pool is a 0.30% pool wearing a temporary anti-sniper surcharge, so it pays what a 0.30%
     * pool pays.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT a share of the elevated launch-window fee. That surcharge exists to
     * compensate LPs for being sniped; taking a quarter of it would mean the protocol profits
     * most from the launches that go worst for the people providing liquidity.
     *
     * For reference, infinity-core's controller defaults dynamic pools to a flat 300 pips
     * (`ProtocolFeeController.sol:39`). Ours is higher because theirs is a general-purpose
     * default and this one is sized to a specific, known population of pools.
