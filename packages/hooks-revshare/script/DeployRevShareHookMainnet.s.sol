/**
 * Deploys `RevShareHook` to a MAINNET chain.
 *
 * The only script here before this one was `ExerciseSepolia.s.sol`, which
 * deploys a hook AND drives a full revenue cycle through it. That is the right
 * shape for a testnet and the wrong one for mainnet: it creates pools, adds
 * liquidity and swaps, none of which should happen as a side effect of a
 * deployment.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP IS SET IN THE CONSTRUCTOR, not transferred afterwards. `RevShareHook`
 * passes `owner_` straight to `Ownable(owner_)`, so there is no two-step dance and
 * no window where the deployer owns it. Per CLAUDE.md's Ownership table:
 *
 *   owner    -> Safe (the governance multisig, directly). Sets the guardian,
 *               pauses and unpauses. Global switches only; cannot reach user funds.
 *   guardian -> Ops. Can ONLY pause, never unpause. A pause during an incident
 *               cannot wait for two signatures, and a guardian that could unpause
 *               would be an owner wearing a smaller name.
 *
 * `renounceOwnership` reverts `RenounceDisabled` on this source, and the script
 * asserts it after deploy.
 *
 * The hook takes no fee until a pool owner calls `configure`, so deploying it
 * changes nothing on its own — it is infrastructure waiting to be pointed at.
 *
 * ####################### THE DELAY IS SECONDS NOW #######################
 *
 * DECIDED 2026-09-13 (Option B). The two hooks already on Robinhood are
 * block-denominated: `0x23CE…E446` (3 600 blocks, ~12 h on Nitro's real ~12 s
 * contract clock, no expiry) and `0xfC00…2aD2` (432 000 blocks declared at the
 * RPC's 0.1 s, so ~60 DAYS, with a ~360-day proposal TTL). This source takes the
 * delay in seconds of `block.timestamp` and has no block-time argument at all.
 *
 * `REVSHARE_CONFIG_DELAY_SECONDS` must be inside [12 h, 14 days]; 43200 is the
 * floor and the recommended value. The proposal TTL is a constant 3 days.
 *
 * THE CLOCK CHECK stays, in its timestamp form: before broadcasting, `run()` probes
 * the chain's `block.timestamp` and refuses unless it agrees with the RPC header
 * (60 s) and with this machine's wall clock (300 s). No waiting.
 *
 * Usage (dry run first — no --broadcast):
 *   CL_POOL_MANAGER=0xf4A28fA4CFeCAEf349A7D52fA1eB4dF56EB22F66
 *   REVSHARE_OWNER=<governance Safe>  REVSHARE_GUARDIAN=<ops key>
 *   REVSHARE_CONFIG_DELAY_SECONDS=43200  REVSHARE_MAX_BENEFICIARIES=8
 *   forge script script/DeployRevShareHookMainnet.s.sol --rpc-url <chain>
