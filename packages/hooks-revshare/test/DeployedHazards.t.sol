/**
 * ####### THE HAZARDS OF THE DEPLOYED HOOK, AND THE FIXES THAT ANSWER THEM #######
 *
 * `RevShareHook` is live and immutable at `0x23CE34E8199927DD270dddd8579c947542bDE446`
 * on Robinhood Chain (4663). This file used to assert the CURRENT behaviour of that
 * instance on purpose, so that CLAUDE.md's "Deployed and unfixable" section could be
 * checked rather than believed - with the standing note that "if one of these tests
 * starts FAILING against a new implementation, that is the fix landing".
 *
 * THE FIX HAS LANDED. Four of the five hazards are closed in this source tree, so the
 * tests that pinned them have been inverted rather than deleted: each `test_FIXED_*`
 * below asserts the new behaviour and states, in its own comment, what the deployed
 * instance does instead. Read as a pair with the runbook, they are the difference
 * between "we fixed it" and a demonstration.
 *
 *   B1  renounceOwnership()          -> FIXED. Overridden to revert.
 *   B3  empty roster + freezeConfig  -> FIXED. Three guards, none reachable around.
 *   B4  freezeConfig is irreversible -> STILL TRUE, and correct. Unchanged below.
 *   B5  a matured proposal is eternal-> FIXED. Expiry, plus clearing on reduce/disable.
 *   3b  CONFIG_DELAY_BLOCKS = 6 min  -> FIXED. See `test_FIXED_B3b_*`.
 *
 * NONE OF THIS REACHES THE LIVE INSTANCE. The deployed hook keeps every one of these
 * hazards until the pool at `poolKey.hooks == 0x23CE...` is replaced, which cannot
 * happen for an existing pool because `poolKey.hooks` is immutable. The operational
 * rules in CLAUDE.md stay in force for that instance and only for that instance.
