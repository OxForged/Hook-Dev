/// @title RevShareHook
/// @notice "Donations and holder share of trading volume" for Latch Protocol CL pools, built as
/// three composable pull-based routes with no on-chain iteration over holders.
///
/// @dev ############### THE CONSTRAINT THAT DETERMINES THE WHOLE DESIGN ###############
///
/// YOU CANNOT PAY TOKEN HOLDERS FROM A SWAP CALLBACK. A holder set is unbounded and anybody can
/// grow it for the price of a dust transfer, so any loop over holders inside `afterSwap` is a
/// permanent, attacker-triggered denial of service on the pool's swap path. Nor can the hook push
/// funds to a small fixed set of recipients: a single recipient that reverts on receive - a
/// contract with no `receive()`, a blacklisting token, a proxy mid-upgrade - takes the pool
/// offline until somebody fixes it, and "somebody" may be an adversary.
///
/// Everything below follows from that. The hook does exactly two things in the swap path:
/// it adds to at most two integers, and it hands value to routes that require no iteration.
/// All payout is pulled by the receiver, in the receiver's own transaction.
///
/// ------------------------------- WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM -------------------------------
///
/// The cut is taken in `afterSwap` as a hook delta on the UNSPECIFIED currency, which requires
/// (and this contract declares) `afterSwapReturnsDelta`. Concretely:
///
///   * exact-input swap  -> the unspecified currency is the OUTPUT. The swapper receives
///                          `out - cut` instead of `out`.
///   * exact-output swap -> the unspecified currency is the INPUT. The swapper pays
///                          `in + cut` instead of `in`.
///
/// This does NOT touch, collide with, or double-charge the protocol fee. The protocol fee is
/// skimmed off the swap INPUT by `CLPool.swap` before the LP fee is applied to the remainder
/// (`total = protocolFee + lpFee - protocolFee*lpFee/1e6`, protocol fee capped at 4000 pips).
/// This hook's cut is applied afterwards, to a different quantity, by a different actor. A trader
/// on a pool with `protocolFee = 1000`, `lpFee = 3000` and `feePips = 10_000` pays 0.3997% of
/// input to the pool/protocol and 1% of output to the revenue share. Those are two separate
/// charges and neither is computed from the other.
///
/// Deliberately NOT used: a `beforeSwap` LP-fee override. That route would fold the revenue share
/// into the LP fee, which (a) only works on a dynamic-fee pool - core SILENTLY DISCARDS a returned
/// fee when `fee != 0x800000` - and (b) pays the whole thing to liquidity providers, which is only
/// one of the three routes below.
///
/// ------------------------------- THE THREE ROUTES -------------------------------
///
/// The cut is split by basis points across three sinks, which sum to exactly 10_000:
///
///  1. `lpDonateBps` - LPs, via the protocol's native `CLPoolManager.donate`. This is the cheapest
///     and most native "share of volume": `donate` bumps `feeGrowthGlobal`, so every in-range
///     liquidity provider is paid pro rata with no iteration, no list, and no claim contract.
///     It is O(1) and it cannot fail on a recipient, because there is no recipient. When the pool
///     has zero in-range liquidity `donate` would revert, so this share is SKIPPED (the cut
///     shrinks) rather than allowed to brick the swap.
///
///  2. `beneficiaryBps` - a bounded, named roster: a treasury, a charity or donation address, a
///     creator. The swap path adds the whole share to ONE integer (`pendingBeneficiary`). A
///     separate, permissionless `settleBeneficiaries` call splits that pot across the roster by
///     weight, and each recipient later `claim`s. The weighted split loop is bounded by
///     `MAX_BENEFICIARIES` AND lives outside the swap path, so neither a long roster nor a hostile
///     recipient can affect a trade.
///
///  3. `distributorBps` - an epoch distributor, for arbitrary token holders. The swap path adds to
///     one integer; a distributor contract PULLS the accrued amount when it closes an epoch.
///     See `distributors/MerkleEpochDistributor.sol` (any ERC20, off-chain root, escrowed per
///     epoch) and `distributors/SnapshotEpochDistributor.sol` (ERC-5805 / ERC20Votes tokens,
///     fully trustless, exact per-holder accrual). Detect which one applies to your token; do not
///     assume. A distributor that reverts, stalls, or is never deployed can only strand its own
///     share - it can never revert a swap.
///
/// A deployment picks its mix. `10_000 / 0 / 0` is a pure LP-donation pool. `0 / 10_000 / 0` is a
/// pure treasury/charity split. `0 / 0 / 10_000` is a pure holder-dividend pool.
///
/// ------------------------------- CUSTODY -------------------------------
///
/// Retained value (routes 2 and 3) is taken as ERC-6909 vault claims via `IVault.mint`, NOT via
/// `IVault.take`. `take` performs a real ERC20 transfer out of the vault in the middle of somebody
/// else's lock; that both hands control to the token contract inside the swap path and mutates the
/// vault's ERC20 balance between a router's `sync` and its `settle`, which is exactly the
/// accounting a `settle` reads (`paid = balanceOfSelf() - reservesBefore`). `mint` is pure vault
/// bookkeeping: no external call, no balance change, no reentrancy surface, and cheaper. Claims
/// are converted to real tokens lazily by `redeem`, which takes its own lock, outside any swap.
///
/// ------------------------------- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO -------------------------------
///
///  * It does not identify traders. `sender` in every hook callback is the VAULT LOCKER (the
///    router), not the end user, and `hookData` is attacker-controlled. Nothing here is keyed on
///    either. There are no per-wallet rules and there cannot be.
///  * It does not tax liquidity operations, donations, or transfers - only swaps against this pool.
///  * It is CL-only. There is deliberately no Bin variant: minting into a bin pool's active bin at
///    a non-bin ratio is an implicit swap, so a Bin revenue share that only hooks `swap` would
///    leave a free route around itself. Doing it correctly needs `beforeMint`/`afterMint`
///    accounting, which is a different contract, not a flag on this one.
///  * It does not make a token's holders whole. Route 3 pays whoever a distributor says to pay.
///    With `MerkleEpochDistributor` that is an off-chain computation and a trusted root poster;
///    with `SnapshotEpochDistributor` it is on-chain and trustless but only counts DELEGATED
///    voting units. Both trade-offs are documented on those contracts. Do not market route 3 as
///    trustless unless you deployed the snapshot variant.

                       CONFIGURATION (PER POOL)

        ACCESS-CONTROL MODEL
        --------------------
        A PoolKey is not owned by anybody - anyone may build a key naming this hook - and a
        callback's `sender` is the router, so ownership can be derived from neither. It is
        established by explicit first claim, exactly as `LaunchGuardHook` does it:

          1. `configure(key, params)` on an unclaimed pool id makes the caller its owner.
          2. `beforeInitialize` REFUSES to let the pool be created unless a claim already exists,
             so there is no such thing as an initialised-but-unconfigured pool on this hook.
          3. While the pool is still uninitialised the owner may reconfigure freely: nobody has
             traded yet, so there is nothing to sandwich.
          4. Once the pool is initialised, raising the take goes through `proposeConfig` +
             `applyPendingConfig`, separated by `CONFIG_DELAY_BLOCKS`. Lowering it does not.
          5. `freezeConfig` is one-way and ends the owner's power over the fee permanently.
