/// @title SnapshotEpochDistributor
/// @notice Route 3 for a token that CAN prove its own history: pay holders their exact pro-rata
/// share of an epoch's fees, computed on-chain from ERC-5805 checkpoints, with no root, no
/// off-chain job, and no trusted party anywhere in the flow.
///
/// @dev ############################ WHY THIS ONE IS TRUSTLESS ############################
///
/// `MerkleEpochDistributor` exists because a plain ERC20 cannot answer "who held this at block N".
/// An ERC20Votes / ERC-5805 token can: `getPastVotes(account, t)` and `getPastTotalSupply(t)` are
/// binary searches over checkpoints the token itself wrote. So `closeEpoch` records a timepoint,
/// and every claim derives its own amount:
///
///     payout = pot * getPastVotes(account, timepoint) / getPastTotalSupply(timepoint)
///
/// There is no admin function on this contract at all. Nobody posts anything, nobody can cancel
/// anything, and nobody can move an epoch's funds anywhere except to a holder who proves their own
/// balance. Prefer this variant whenever the token supports it.
///
/// ------------------------------- THE CATCH, STATED PLAINLY -------------------------------
///
/// THE NUMERATOR AND THE DENOMINATOR DO NOT MEASURE THE SAME THING, and that asymmetry is the
/// single most important fact about this contract:
///
///   * `getPastVotes(account, t)` counts DELEGATED VOTING UNITS. In OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Votes` a
///     holder who has never called `delegate` has `getPastVotes == 0` however large their balance.
///   * `getPastTotalSupply(t)` counts the token's TOTAL supply of voting units. `Votes` pushes to
///     `_totalCheckpoints` on mint and burn only - delegation never touches it - so undelegated
///     balances ARE in the denominator. OpenZeppelin says as much on the function itself: "this is
///     not necessarily the sum of all delegated votes".
///
/// So the numerators sum to the denominator only when every unit of supply is delegated, and are
/// strictly smaller otherwise. That direction is deliberate and must not be inverted: a denominator
/// that is always at least the sum of the numerators is what makes the epoch solvent BY
/// CONSTRUCTION, before the flooring and the escrow ceiling in `claim` are considered at all.
///
/// There is no on-chain fix. ERC-5805 exposes no total-delegated figure, and having the caller
/// supply the delegate set instead would let an incomplete list shrink the denominator, over-draw
/// the epoch and turn `claim` into a first-come-first-served race. Total supply is the only
/// denominator this contract can trust.
///
/// Consequences a deployment must own:
///   * Undelegated holders receive NOTHING, and their share is NOT redistributed to delegated
///     holders - nobody can claim it, so it sits in the epoch until `rollover` returns it to the
///     next one. No value is lost, but only `delegatedSupply / totalSupply` of each pot is paid
///     out per epoch and the rest churns. "All holders share the fees" is FALSE unless every
///     holder has self-delegated. Say "delegated holders" in the marketing copy, or - much better
///     - ship a token whose `_update` auto-delegates, which collapses the two figures into one.
///   * Watch this especially when the votes token is one of the pool's own currencies: the
///     liquidity parked in the Vault is undelegated supply sitting in the denominator.
///   * A token can be delegated to an address that cannot receive the payout currency. That
///     strands one holder's share until `rollover`, and affects nobody else - `claim` is pull.
///
/// ------------------------------- CLOCK HANDLING -------------------------------
///
/// The timepoint domain is the token's, not ours. ERC-6372 lets a token be block-numbered or
/// timestamped, and reading `getPastVotes` with the wrong domain silently returns garbage - a
/// timestamp is a far-future block number, which reverts, and a block number is a 1970 timestamp,
/// which returns the token's genesis state. So the constructor PROBES `clock()` and records the
/// answer instead of assuming, and falls back to `block.number` per ERC-6372's default only when
/// the token does not implement it. This is the "detect, don't assume" requirement, and it is the
/// single most likely thing to get silently wrong when integrating a new token.

    ///     epoch that closes a full `minEpochDuration` later. One block of exposure, as now. What
    ///     changes is that they must bet on a future pot instead of seeing the present one, which
    ///     lowers expected value but does not remove the attack.
    ///   * IT SEALS THE SET. Today a large honest buyer before the close dilutes a sniper. Under a
    ///     pre-recorded timepoint nobody can dilute anybody, and a mid-epoch buyer earns nothing
