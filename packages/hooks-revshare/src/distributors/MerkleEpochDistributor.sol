/// @title MerkleEpochDistributor
/// @notice Route 3 for an ordinary ERC20 with no snapshot support: pay arbitrary token holders a
/// share of trading volume by closing an epoch, publishing a Merkle root of the holder set, and
/// letting holders claim against it.
///
/// @dev ############################ WHY A MERKLE ROOT AT ALL ############################
///
/// A plain ERC20 records no history. `balanceOf` today says nothing about who held the token
/// while the volume that generated this epoch's fees was traded, and there is no on-chain way to
/// ask. Iterating holders is impossible for the reasons set out on `RevShareHook`. So the holder
/// set is computed off-chain over the epoch's block range, committed as one 32-byte root, and
/// each holder proves their own entry when they claim. On-chain cost is O(log n) per claimer and
/// zero for everybody else - including for the swap that funded it.
///
/// ------------------------------- THE TRUST ASSUMPTION -------------------------------
///
/// THIS CONTRACT IS NOT TRUSTLESS AND MUST NOT BE MARKETED AS IF IT WERE. Somebody computes the
/// root off-chain, and this contract cannot check that the root reflects the real holder set. A
/// dishonest root poster can assign an epoch's entire pot to themselves.
///
/// What IS enforced on-chain, and bounds the damage:
///
///   * PER-EPOCH ESCROW. `claimed` is tracked per epoch per currency and can never exceed that
///     epoch's own `amount`. A bad root steals at most the epoch it was posted for. It cannot
///     reach into another epoch, the pot still accruing in the hook, or any other pool.
///   * ONE ROOT PER EPOCH. `postRoot` reverts if a root is already set, so a poster cannot swap
///     an honest root for a hostile one after claims begin.
///   * A CHALLENGE WINDOW. Claims open only `challengeDelay` seconds after the root is posted.
///     During that window `cancelRoot` (owner or guardian) clears the root so a corrected one can
///     be posted. After it, the root is final and even the owner cannot touch the funds.
///   * NO ADMIN WITHDRAWAL. There is no function that moves an epoch's balance to the owner.
///     Unclaimed value goes to `rollover`, which returns it to the next epoch's holders. The owner
///     can stall the process; the owner cannot take the money.
///
/// Deploy this with the root poster behind the same multisig + timelock that governs
/// `Vault.registerApp`, publish the epoch's block range and the generator, and say plainly that
/// holder payouts depend on an off-chain computation. If you need a trustless guarantee instead,
/// the paired token must support ERC-5805 checkpoints - use `SnapshotEpochDistributor`.
///
/// ------------------------------- LEAF ENCODING -------------------------------
///
///   leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(index, account, amount0, amount1))))
///
/// Double hashing, and `abi.encode` (fixed 128-byte preimage) rather than `abi.encodePacked`, so
/// no leaf can be confused with an internal node and no two distinct claims can share an encoding.
/// `index` is the claimant's position in the generated tree and is what the claim bitmap keys on.
///
/// ------------------------------- FINDING THE TREE -------------------------------
///
/// A root is 32 bytes and a claim needs a PROOF, so a root on its own is unclaimable by anyone who
/// was not handed the tree out of band. `postRoot` therefore takes a pointer to where the tree is
/// published, stored per epoch and readable through `getRootSource`. It is a pointer and nothing
/// more - see the notes on that function for what it is and is not evidence of.

     *
     * What bounds the damage is that THE ROOT IS THE AUTHORITY, not this string.
     * A tree served from a hostile pointer produces proofs that fail
     * `MerkleProof.verifyCalldata`, so the worst a bad URI achieves on chain is
     * denial of service - which the owner already has by never posting a root -
     * and off chain, a phishing page. It cannot move one wei.
     *
     * `revisions` is the anti-phishing surface: a pointer that has moved since
     * the root was posted is a fact a claim UI should show, and counting
     * `RootURIUpdated` logs to learn it would bound the answer by however far
     * back an RPC serves logs. It is on chain for the same reason
     * `RevShareHook.totalTaken` is.
     *
     * Reverts for an epoch that does not exist. An epoch with no root returns an
